The futuristic footwear was donned by Marty McFly in hit movie, Back To The Future Part II.

Now, 30 years later we could finally see these tech trainers landing on feet.

Nike has just teased futuristic fans with Tweet sent directly to BAck to the Future actor Michael J Fox simply saying ""see you tomorrow"".

While this is no guarantee that Nike will unveil its new shoes, they clearly have something they want to share.

Nike has however refused to comment further on what it has planned for Back to the Future Day.

This is not the first time Nike has teased self-lacing shoes.

During an appearance in earlier this year, Nike designer Tinker Hatfield suggested that Marty McFly's futuristic shoes might be on their way.

He said: ”Are we gonna see power laces in 2015? To that, I say YES!""

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/471256/Star-Wars-Battlefront-secrets-revealed","Major Star Wars secrets uncovered weeks before release","Data miners, whizkids who know how to unearth secrets in game code, have been ploughing through the shooter game's 'beta' test.

And hidden within the code for the online teaser of the game last week is a host of information.

They've put together a 21-page Google document detailing everything about the full game they've found.

And it's jam-packed with details about the maps, weapons and achievements you can expect come launch day.

Electronic Arts ran the 'beta' for several days last week to stress test servers for online battle and iron out kinks.

Fans had a blast shooting at each other for free on the part-game trial.

Redditor me_and_my_johnson, who compiled the document, says that ""This is not necessarily everything that will be in the final game.

""It is possible things have been added/changed since the beta build was completed.""

He added: ""The reason I’ve made this is because I’ve seen a lot of hate towards the game, based on opinions formed during the beta and from lack of information.

""I feel as though EA’s marketing team has been underhyping the game in the way they’ve been releasing information, which has caused unnecessary anger to be formed against their game.

""I really liked the beta, and I believe the game has been made as a great product of Star Wars passion.

""I am trying to help people understand that it really isn’t a step down from the previous Battlefronts in many ways, it is just a newer modern version of the originals.""

The beta was limited, giving access to just two multiplayer maps and one survival mode map.

But the experts have found a plethora of details about what else you'll enjoy in the full game.

Weapons include the 'versatile heavy blaster' RT-97C, the A280 'a sturdy high-rate of fire shooter', the CA-87 'a retro-fitted Jawa blaster' and the EE-3 'an optically fitted rifle of three-round bursts'.

As well as playing as Darth Vadar and Luke Skywalker, you will also be able to play as Emperor Palpatine, Han Solo and Princess Leia.

Planets to visit in the game include Hoth, Tatooine, Endor and Sullust.

Achievements include 'great shot kid!', 'never tell me the odds!' and 'a cunning warrior'.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/471200/HTC-One-M9-Apple-iPhone-lookalike","Can this iPhone lookalike convince Apple fans it's time for Android?","There's a new Google-powered Android phone in town...but it wouldn't look out of place in an Apple Store.

The HTC One A9 has just been unveiled by the Taiwanese tech giant and it looks almost identical to the iPhone 6s.

Although on the outside it may have all the hallmarks of an Apple smartphone, there's no sign of the US tech firm when you hit the on button.

HTC is launching the A9 with the latest version of Android Marshmallow and they say they've worked closely with Google to make sure users get the ultimate experience.

Google’s latest OS brings plenty of extras to this phone including Android Pay and Google’s Now on Tap feature.

This intuitively provides contextual information about whatever is on your screen – look up reviews for a movie from a text, hear a song mentioned in a blog post, or book seats at a restaurant from an email, all at the press of the home button.

Other features on this new device include a decent Qualcomm processor, 32GB of expandable memory and a fingerprint scanner.

There's also a 5 inch, Full HD display and 13-megapixel rear camera with Optical Image Stabilisation.

HTC has also worked hard to improve the sound quality on its latest phone with the A9 now featuring Hi-Res audio playback.

Although the A9 has a relatively small battery HTC are boasting that it will give users plenty of life.

Doze automatically turns off power hungry applications when your phone is left idle and HTC reckon its new features are all optimised to maximise battery life throughout the day.

Speaking about the device Cher Wang, chairwoman and CEO, HTC said: “Today we’re taking that heritage of innovation to the next level, unveiling a phone that stands apart in a market increasingly dominated by a company which controls every aspect of your phone.

""The HTC One A9 breaks from this trend by offering an incredible design, fantastic performance, cutting-edge software features and the freedom to take full control of your smartphone experience.“

Hands-on with HTC One A9

Daily Star Online has had an exclusive hands-on with the HTC One A9 and we’ve been left surprisingly impressed.

Although it appears an odd decision for HTC to launch another flagship device alongside its current smartphones, the A9 offers something fresh to the range.

The A9 looks and feels just like an iPhone with a soft, curved design and premium metal finish.

However, on the inside there’s no sign of Apple.

Running the latest version of Android Marshmallow sets this device apart from most of the competition and with HTC working closely with Google the user experience is fast and fluid.

The display is good and with a host of extras such as fingerprint scanner and Hi-Res audio playback there’s plenty to get excited about.

We only had a short time with the A9 but our initial impressions are good.

HTC say they are aiming this smartphone at a new younger audience and if the price is right it could go down a storm.

An A9 will be arriving with us shortly and we’ll have a full review for you soon.

The HTC One A9 will be available in the UK from the beginning of November 2015.

The device will be available in Carbon Grey, Opal Silver and Topaz Gold and will be stocked by retailers and operators including EE, O2, Vodafone, Carphone Warehouse, John Lewis, Amazon, Mobile Phones Direct.

Prices are yet to be revealed.","geeky"

Back to the Future 2 hit cinema's in 1989 and was the movie that took kids to the modern world of 2015.

The film showed how we'd all be using a host of incredible tech, but how much has actually become reality?

We take a look at what Back to the Future 2 got right and wrong.

SMARTWATCHES: Stars in the movie are seen getting instant weather reports on smartwatches.

All the big guns of tech including Samsung and LG launched tech timepieces in 2014 and Apple's new device finally arrived earlier this year.

So, smartwatches are here..shame no one is wearing them.

HOVERBOARDS: OK, so we're not all whizzing around on flying skateboards but a number of these futuristic modes of transport have been created.

The Hendo Hoverboard is the latest to make and appearance and has even been ridden by pro skater, Tony Hawk.

Lexus has also made a floating skateboard although it does need a special metal road to fly on.

And the new self-balancing scooters, nicknamed the hoverboard, are set to be the Christmas hit of 2015.

Sadly, had Marty McFly landed in Britain in 2015 he wouldn't have been allowed to ride his hoverboard as they've just been banned.

SMART GLASSES: They're not quite mainstream yet but Google's Glass did make a brief appearance in 2015.

Virtual reality glasses are also on there way with the incredible Oculus Rift device landing on heads soon.

HTC, Sony and Microsoft are also producing tech specs which will all launch in 2016.

VIDEO CALLING: It was just a dream in 1984, but we can now video call from our mobile phones, TVs and tablets.

PICK YOUR OWN SCENERY: Back to the Future 2 said we'd all have windows with pick your own scenery.

LG and other companies are producing screens as thin as glass and many smart TVs allow you to choose animated scenes.

FLYING CARS: These airbourne machines were a big part of the 80's movie and although many of us dream of flying away from motorway jams, it's a long way from ever happening.

However, autonomous vehicles are here already with Google, Mercedes and Honda all testing driverless cars.

SELF DRYING CLOTHES: Brits are used to getting caught out in a downpour but sadly we're still having to dry our soggy socks on the office radiator.

REJUVENATION CENTRE: In 2015 we were all supposed to head to the local rejuvenation centre to get everything from our blood to spleen replaced.

We have got botox but imagine the queue of haggared celebs if rejuvenation centers were real.

FOOD HYDRATORS: Pop your tiny pizza into the food hydrator and within seconds a full-sized hot and tasty snack is ready and waiting.

Yes, we do have microwave pizzas but we'd rather eat a lump of cardboard.

JAWS 19: As McFly walks through his local town in 2015 the latest blockbuster movie in cinemas is Jaws 19, thankfully the franchise stopped at 'Jaws 4: The Revenge'.

SELF-LACING SHOES: It's the ultimate in laziness, just pop your feet in your trainers and let the power laces do the rest.

Nike are thought to be developing a pair, but at the minute you're just going to have to use your fingers.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/471123/Apple-iPhone-Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Force-3D-Touch","Samsung is 'fast-tracking its next smartphone to try and compete with Apple'","Samsung is expected to bring forward its Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone launch to January in an attempt to compete with rival Apple.

The South Korean technology firm has previously announced its flagship smartphone on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress tradeshow, which is held between late February and early March.

But the hugely popular Android manufacturer is believed to be hard at work to bring the event forward.

A separate January event will be held to launched the new Samsung Galaxy S7, according to unnamed sources quoted in the South Korea Electronic Times.

Samsung has already broken its usual smartphone schedule this year.

The technology firm unveiled its Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy Edge + smartphone during a standalone event in August ahead of its typical September announcement alongside IFA.

Apple released its latest smartphone models – the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus – in September.

The headline feature of the new Apple smartphones is 3D Touch, which brings pressure sensitivity to the 4.7 and 5.5inch displays.

Samsung is expected to unveil its own version of the technology, based on a technique developed by Synaptics, at the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S7.

Dubbed ClearForce, the 3D Touch alternative will respond to various levels of screen pressure.

The pressure sensitive technology will allow Samsung to add more control options to the display than the traditional swipe, pinch and tap used on multi-touch smartphones.

The ClearForce technology will be able to control scrolling speeds with pressure, add new ways to zoom and pan over photographs, summon hidden contextual menus, according to Synaptics.

Unfortunately the success of the technology depends on the implementation by Samsung.

Different Android manufacturers could use the technology in different ways, too.

This could lead to a dramatically different experience on Samsung, as opposed to HTC, for example.

Google would have to incorporate pressure sensitive technology within its pure version of Android to create some consistency.

However Samsung has a history of making new technology popular through its Galaxy smartphone range.

In recent years, the South Korean firm has helped to popularise features such as heart-rate sensors and fingerprint readers.

Samsung is expected to continue using its award-winning curved display technology, albeit only in the larger of the two Galaxy smartphones.

It is believed the Galaxy S7 will ship in 5.2inch and 5.8inch models, with only the 5.8inch model getting the curved Edge treatment.","geeky"

Security analysts found 256 apps hosted by the iOS App Store which were quietly gathering private information and tracking Apple users.

The infected apps – which included an official McDonalds iOS app – have affected one million users in total, it has been claimed.

Adverts hosted within the apps have been secretly tracking iPhone and iPad owners' email addresses, unique serial numbers and other personal information.

Analytics firm Source DNA, which first discovered the slew of affected apps, believes some developers could be unaware their iOS app is being used to siphon customers' private information.

Chinese mobile advert provider Youmi is believed to be responsible for the harvesting of information, according to Source DNA.

Founder of Source DNA Nate Lawson told Ars Technica: ""This is the first time we've found apps live in the App Store that are violating user privacy by pulling data from private APIs.

""It's definitely the kind of stuff that Apple should have caught.""

Apple has a strict privacy policy and vetting process for its hugely popular App Store.

The 256 apps identified by SourceDNA are accessing data explicitly forbidden by Apple's App Store rules, Mr Lawson added.

Certain apps running the Youmi mobile advert network were found to be collecting serial numbers for cameras and other hardware components, as well as the email address associated with your Apple ID.

A spokesperson for Apple said: ""We’ve identified a group of apps that are using a third-party advertising SDK, developed by Youmi, a mobile advertising provider, that uses private APIs to gather private information, such as user email addresses and device identifiers, and route data to its company server.

""This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines.

""The apps using Youmi’s SDK will be removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected.

""We are working closely with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in compliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly.""

The latest App Store cull comes after Apple removed dozens of popular apps from its Chinese App Store.

The infected software was developed using a clone of Apple's own iOS app creator, dubbed Xcode Ghost, which laced the apps with a mobile virus.

Three says the boost will be nationwide as part of an ongoing rollout to bring users better mobile broadband.

The new speedy service has already been switched on in Northern England, the West Midlands, Scotland and Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK, including London, coming soon.

It's also hoped that the new technology will help to further improve reliability by adding some much needed capacity in congested areas.

Bryn Jones, chief technology officer at Three, said: “Many of our 4G customers will already be enjoying a faster, more reliable experience at no extra cost. Our network processes a huge amount of data and we will continue to work hard on providing them with a service that delivers the reliability and speed that they need.”

Although Three are clearly chuffed with their new speeds they might need to get even better in the future.

Top boffins have just managed to achieve record-breaking data speeds using the latest 5G technology.

The speeds are so fast that experts say 100 feature films could be downloaded in just three seconds.

If you have Microsoft Edge set as your default and attempt to install another web browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, and then try to switch the defaults in your settings a ""Give Microsoft Edge a shot"" dialogue box appears.

The prompt highlights some of the new features in Edge, including the ability to annotate webpages using a stylus, in-built Cortana integration and the distraction-free Reading Mode.

""Before you switch defaults, see what you can do in an app built just for Windows 10,"" it reads.

The Windows 10 prompt even has a large bold button titled ""Don't switch and try it now"" which launches Edge and keeps it the default browser for the operating system.

Whether this small change will make any difference to Edge's popularity remains to be seen.

According to Thomas, it's relatively easy for hackers to gain access to this sensitive data with his blog explaining: ""If a malicious party obtained identifiable access logs for just one of the websites that know your name, and view logs for just one of the adult websites you’ve visited, it could infer with very high probability - beyond plausible deniability - a list of porn you've viewed.

""At any time, somebody could post a website that allows you to search anybody by email or facebook username and view their porn browsing history.

""All that's needed are two nominal data breaches and an enterprising teenager that wants to create havoc.""

Thomas goes on to explain that even viewing content in private or Incognito modes, still leaves a unique footprint every time you visit a web page.

Almost all sites you visit will track you, as this data is incredibly valuable to companies and each visit saves enough data to link your user account to your browser fingerprint.

Yet the 25-year-old wows her friends and family by hauling her sizeable frame up 11ft poles and gliding gracefully to the ground.

Overweight Eda’s rise to the top is remarkable as she has only been dancing for two years – and never did any form of exercise before.

But a clip of her doing her thing went viral and received a whopping eight million views in just a few days.

""I feel way more confident, way more sexy, way more beautiful than ever before,"" she said.

And her husband, Terrik, 26,is her biggest fan. He said: “Her pole dancing is sexy to me. I know a lot of people don’t like it and a lot of people talk bad about it and frankly I don’t care.

“It makes her feel sexy, it makes her feel happy and that’s what I like about it.""

But not everyone loved her video, and Eda was inundated with hateful comments. Some called her ""disgusting"" and ""fat"", while others even told her to kill herself.

But Eda is shunning the negativity and concentrating on her goals. The inspiring dancer hopes to lose an incredible 14st to compete in the state pole dancing competitions.

And she's well on her way, having shed an incredible 4.5st in just a few months.

“I’ve come so far in the past two years,"" she said. “I feel like I’m worth it. I never thought I would be capable of the things I have achieved.”

The young accountant coordinator always had issues with her body growing up and went a year without looking in the mirror.

But now Eda, confronts her curves in the mirrored studio every year.

“I was in denial about how much weight I had put on and how I looked,"" she said.

“When I walked into the pole dancing studio for the first time I weighed 330lbs and the entire room was covered in mirrors. It was quite a shock.”

Brunette Eva, from Missouri, USA, battled with anorexia for eight years as a teenager and young adult.

Her lowest weight was 9.5st, but she was starving herself and miserable. She would eat just a few bites of food and convince herself she was feeling sick and then fill her belly with at least three energy drinks.

Feeling alone and depressed, it wasn’t until she met her husband, Terrik, seven years ago, that her confidence began to creep back up.

But instead of eating healthily, Eda binged and her lack of exercise meant her weight began to balloon. After five years of fizzy drinks and junk food her weight reached 18.5st.

Her confidence plummeted to rock-bottom and she couldn't stand to look at herself or have her picture taken.

Although Eda’s self-belief was at an all-time low, her husband Terrik tried to make her see why he adored her, constantly telling her that she was beautiful just the way she was.

Then two years ago, Eda decided to turn her life around and she came across the all-women Pink Lemon Studio near St Louis and decided to try pole dancing.

Her first experience was nerve-wracking and Eda dreaded the worst. She was surrounded by mirrors that she was too terrified to look into and she felt self-conscious on the pole.

But after a few classes she was hooked. Soon Eda was climbing the 11ft pole and twirling gracefully to the bottom and shaking her voluptuous hips.

“I was not good when I first started. I was afraid to take my feet off the ground,"" she said. “It took me a year and three months to climb the pole because I’m afraid of heights.”

Now Eda is spinning herself thin. She has already shed 4.5st and hopes to lose another 2.5st by the end of the year.

“Eventually I’d like to be under 200lbs. I was never built to weigh as much as I do,"" she said.

But it's the emotional changes that have really impacted her life.

She said: “I felt more confident and I have friends. The way I dressed changed, I started to care a little bit more about what I was wearing and how I would do my hair.

“Before I started pole I wouldn’t wear make-up, I didn’t like to take the time to look after myself.

“It’s nice to take the five or ten minutes to take time to make myself a special occasion. I fell better than ever before.""","boorish"

And after deciding they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together they embarked on a mission to morph into Barbie and Ken.

The couple have since splashed a staggering £209,000 to look more like the famous plastic dolls.

Their list of surgeries includes two boob jobs, four nose jobs, lip injections, butt implants, cheek fillers, ear reshaping surgery, Botox and eye-bag removal.

A large sum has also been spent on fake tanning, teeth whitening, nail extensions and veneers.

And Anastasia even splurged £5,000 of her parent’s money to undergo a second boob job to take her to a 32GG.

""We want to spend the rest of our lives together morphing into the dolls we love,"" said Anastasia, who was born in Russia.

Quentin added: “I couldn’t believe I had met someone who was trying to achieve exactly what I wanted to.

“We discussed all the cosmetic treatments we wanted and what luxury designer labels we liked.

“Together, we could become the ultimate French Barbie and Ken. We were pure class.""

But the couple still haven't perfected their look and hope to get even more surgery. Busty Anastasia wants her ears reshaped, while boyfriend Quentin is hoping for pectoral implants.

Anastasia realised she wanted to ""become Barbie"" at the age of 15.

""My parents bought me all the Barbies I wanted,"" she said. ""At one point I had over 100 and I loved them all, they are so beautiful.""

""When I was 15 I started to become more aware of how I looked. I realised I wanted to become Barbie.""

""I was a good daughter – I studied hard and did very well at school,"" she added. ""At the end of the day, my parents would rather have a teenage daughter who takes care of her appearance than one who takes drugs.""

And while Anastasia was attracted to Barbie's ridiculous proportions and flowing blonde locks, Quentin wanted Ken's luxury lifestyle.

He decided to try and emulate the doll's ""billionaire lifestyle"" to escape his average life.

""At secondary school, I just felt very average. I didn’t feel like me,"" he said. ""I told myself that I had to go back to the idol of my childhood and become Ken.""

""I read more magazines and began looking at various cosmetic procedures,"" he added. ""I wanted to change my all my facial features to emulate Ken.""

The full-lipped stud now owns a Porsche similar to his toy idol's, which he funded through the mobile phone shops he owns.

“Plastic surgery is our passion. We want to spend the rest of our lives together morphing into the dolls we love,"" they added.

A new study reveals that going to bed commando can increase your chances of having a baby (not for that reason you cheeky so-and-so).

Men who wear boxers during the day, but sleep naked at night had 25% less damage to their sperm, compared to the men who wore tighty-whities in bed.

The researchers from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Maryland, and Stanford University followed 500 men for up to 12 months, tracking their underwear choices and monitoring their sperm quality.

And the result confirmed that men should be wearing roomy boxers in the day and none at night – to keep the temperature of their balls down.

""Type of underwear worn during the day and to bed is associated with semen quality,"" said the study's lead author.

""Better [sperm] quality parameters are observed in men wearing boxers during the day and none in bed.""

According to this research, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Baltimore, men who spent more time in the nude are more likely to get their partner pregnant.

Leading fertility expert Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, told the Telegraph: ""We have known for some time that men who increase the temperature of their testicles, either through the heat exposure at work or by wearing tight underwear, have poorer semen quality compared to men whose testicles are cooler.

""What has never adequately been shown is whether men can improve things by changing the choice of their underwear, but this study - although quite small - goes some way to suggest that is true.""

""What we really need to see is whether switching to looser underwear makes their partners get pregnant more often or quicker than they would have done had the men continued to wear tight underwear,"" he added.

The 20-year-old model, whose legs measure a whopping 49.5 inches, now holds the record for the longest legs in America.

Holly, adesign student from Florida, USA has now trumpped current record holder - model Lauren Williams - who has 49 inch pins.

And while she used to get bullied for her statuesque figure, the guys in New York seemed to adore her long legs.

""Back in middle school I was called daddy long legs, tree or giraffe - but the dating scene has gotten better since I moved to New York,"" she said.

""I definitely have seen guys come up to me who have a fetish for long legs. When people see me in heels their jaws hit the floor.""

But the 6ft 5in model says she will only date guys who are over 6ft 3ins.

She said: ""Fortunately New York is full of tall, hot men. If I see someone in a bar who is taller than me I will go straight over and try to chat him up.

""My legs are definitely an asset now, being older I feel like people appreciate them more.""

Holly was always destined to reach great heights as extreme stature runs in her family.

She said: ""I first realised I was really tall when I was in 2nd grade and I was taller than my teacher.

""My mom is 6ft 1in, my dad is 6ft 3in, and my sister is 6ft. I happen to be the youngest and the tallest in my family.

""My grandpa who just passed was 6ft 8in, my uncle is 6ft 7in, so it's a really, really tall family.""

Growing up she used her height to her advantage playing a variety of sports and helping her shorter friends.

""I was always picked first for sports - I played soccer for ten years and basketball for seven or eight - I was included because I was so tall,"" she said.

""I also used my help my friends get stuff from high places a lot.""

But being tall also proved difficult when Holly uses standard sized cars or shops for clothes.

She said: ""It's very difficult taking planes and getting in cars. My ex-boyfriend had a mini cooper and we took that to Florida - it was probably the worst ride of my life.

""My inseam is about 38 inches - I do have a lot of shopping issues when it comes to finding something that fits me.""

For now Holly plans to focus on her studies and graduate college, but hopes her legs will take her far in the future.

She said: ""I love the attention that I get. I've been tall all my life and sometimes I was picked on so now it's like I'm being recognised for something good.

""I'm hoping my legs will generate good opportunities - I'm very open to modelling again.

""I would also be down with doing a little show down with Lauren Williams. She seems like a nice girl and I'm interested in meeting someone with long legs just like me.""","boorish"

Bedridden by her weight for five solid years, she was dubbed ""The Half Tonne Woman"" and was unable to do anything for herself.

But she embarked on a strict diet and lost more than 36 stone, after medical professionals bulldozed the side of her home to free her from her bed after she suffered breathing difficulties.

In a bid to change her life, she transformed her diet and only ate small portions of lean meat, fruit and vegetables and began doing light exercise.

Now 38, Catrina has lost more than half of her body weight and tips the scales at 32st.

However, she has been left with 10st of excess skin, which hangs down to her knees.

Catrina, who has never spoken to the press before, said: ""I'm so much happier now and feel so confident.

""I was in bed for so long that now I've lost the weight I just want to be free.

""I love running around, going to the gym three or four times a week and keeping fit.""

Despite being thrilled with her dwindling waistline, she is desperate to get rid of the excess skin that is weighing her down and causing medical complications.

Speaking from her hospital bed in Tampa, Florida, USA, where she lives, she said: ""I've just been diagnosed with cellulitis (an infection of the skin) after injuring my leg at the gym.

""Doctors say that I need to lose weight to stop injuring myself and having complications, but this heavy skin makes it so hard.""

Following years of sexual abuse as a child, Catrina found comfort in sweet, sugary snacks and secret eating.

By the age of 12, she was so big that her mum had to start making her clothes as shops did not stock sizes large enough.

Aged 14, and weighing 32st, she was admitted to a psychiatric home for eight months to help her deal with her overeating.

Feeling unable to discuss the abuse with anyone, even this did not help and she continued to gain weight.

Soon she did not leave her home at all and would spend days eating and avoiding people.

By this point she was so big that she was unable to move around easily, lost her job and had to move back in with her mum.

For five years after this she was bedbound and her mum would bring her food and a cousin would empty a bed pan.

She spent days on the internet lying to me about her appearance and starting relationships using her fake persona.

""It was the worst time of my life,"" she said. ""I just wanted to die. Each day I'd just eat and go online from morning to night.""

In December 2003, she started having breathing difficulty and medics had to bulldoze her house to transport her to hospital.

""It was the worst thing that had ever happened to me,"" she said. ""But it was the thing that saved me.""

With the help of specialists, a calorie-restricted diet and very light exercise, she went onto lose a stunning 21st naturally – before having a gastric bypass procedure.

She has now lost more than 36st and feels like a new woman. However, her dramatic weight loss has left her with drooping skin across her legs, stomach and arms.

She said ""Last year I bought my first bikini ever. I'm really happy with myself. I don't want my excesses skin removed for my looks.

""I just need the operation to help finish the process I've started and improve my health.""

She has launched a GoFundMe page for donations towards the $10,000 (£6,500) surgery to remove the skin.","boorish"

Here we reveal seven of the most disgusting dishes in the world:

Back in May this year, a restaurant was closed down for serving human flesh to customers.

Bleeding human heads were discovered stored in plastic bags after police raided the restaurant.

A priest who had recently dined at the restaurant, in Anambra, Nigeria, was horrified to discover he had unwittingly become a cannibal.

""The attendant noticed my reaction and told me it was the small piece of meat I had eaten that made the bill that high,"" he said.

""I did not know I had been served with human meat, and that it was that expensive.""

Police are said to have arrested 10 people in connection with the grim discovery.

Beijing's famous penis restaurant serves up schlongs of all shapes and sizes.

People spend hundreds of dollars on delicacies like cooked yak penis or sheep gonads.

Many Chinese people believe chomping on animal genitals increases male potency and does wonders for women's skin.

As a result the Guolizhuang Restaurant has become a huge hit in China's capital.

Imagine tucking into pig brain slapped between two slices of bread – yummy!

The dish was once hugely popular in St. Louis, Missouri, but is now only served in a few restaurants.

Cows brains were originally used but due to the outbreak of mad cow disease the sandwich is now served with pigs brains along with pickles, onions, mustard and ketchup.

You can purchase this delicacy in places including Indiana and Ohio.

An arachnophobe's worst nightmare – a-Ping (fried tarantula) is a popular dish in Cambodia.

People started eating fried spiders in Cambodia back in 1960 when there was a severe food shortage and it has remained a popular snack ever since.

The spiders alone have very little taste so are usually mixed with garlic and other herbs.

Casu Marzu, a pecorino cheese and Sardinian specialty, has to be the most disgusting cheese in the world.

Flies are allowed inside the cheese to lay their eggs,. Then when the maggots hatch they wriggle about fermenting the cheese.

The breeding ground then becomes a delicacy and people eat it up, maggots and all. However, the regional tradition has become illegal due to its inability to meet food sanitation standards.

Soft-boiled duck foetus, known as Balut, is a common street food in both the Philippines and Vietnam.

The underdeveloped baby animal is allowed to grow for a few weeks before it is boiled and eaten.

Peel back the shell and along with a typical soft-boiled eggy interior is also the small inert body of a duck foetus – small bones, feathers, beak and all.

Most restaurants suggest slurping it right from the shell with a pinch of salt.

A mum serves human placenta smoothies from her house.

Kathryn Beale, 41, produces the drinks for new mums from the kitchen of her terraced home and sells them for about £20 each.

She puts a fist-sized fleshy piece of the placenta into a blender after chilling it overnight and mixes it with fruit.

Kathryn insists the smoothies are perfectly safe and that eating placentas has many health benefits.

But council officials are worried about potential ""serious health risks"" and attempted to gain an emergency court order banning her from producing the drinks.

This failed after Kathryn agreed to stop making them until officials can inspect hygiene standards at her home in Swindon, Wiltshire.","boorish"

He told medics that he was initially too embarrassed to ask for treatment, so tried to cut the piles out at home.

But he ended up on the local news after he stuck a cerated sword up his behind.

The razor-sharp tool then got stuck, due to the bizarre position he needed to be in to reach around and slice off the blood-filled globules.

He inevitably slipped and the blade shot up his bottom passage.

The saying ""you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your Prince"" is, according to a new study, not wrong.

But the research revealed there are few limits when it comes to who modern women will kiss - with almost half of British women (44 percent) claiming to have at some stage in their lives, kissed a married man.

The research found pubs (26 percent) and nightclubs (23 percent) to be among the top locations women may try to find ""Mr Right""

However the majority of women (33 percent) claimed they finally found ""the one"" via an introduction through friends rather than randomly on a night out.

According to the research - 21 is the age when women kiss the most ""frogs"" - with the average female claiming she regrets kissing up to four slimeballs in her life.

More than half of the women surveyed (59 percent) said they were actually ""repulsed"" by one of their encounters - with 21 percent saying their date had bad breath.

A stolen kiss with a married man came out top of the biggest regrets with 44 percent, while snogging a work colleague came second with 32 percent.

Another 18 percent admitted to kissing a friend's boyfriend, while 11 percent of women say they have smooched with their boss.

A spokesperson for Smint, who carried out the survey of 2,000 women to launch its new pink Strawberry Mix for Breast Cancer Care, said: ""We love that the new research demonstrates that women are confident in their pursuit of love. We hope a little fruity freshness from Smint leads to more women finding their 'Prince' and a few less frogs!""

GETTY • Pic posed by model

On a happier note, an encouraging 73 percent of women quizzed said they have finally found ""the one"" - however 27 percent are either still kissing the wrong men or have given up on ever finding the right partner.

Psychologist Donna Dawson commented on the research: ""Kissing is a very powerful action and should be used carefully. Lips are integral to 'mating rituals' as they send sensory information to our brains, which in turn connects to our pleasure and arousal zones.

""The chemicals in our saliva also act to heighten the physical attraction between two people. All of this works to create a strong emotional bond between a kissing couple and gives them the illusion of instant compatibility, when this may not be the case in reality.

GETTY • Pic posed by models

""Psychologists have maintained for years that the best way to meet an ideal partner is through a network of friends. Friends have your best interests at heart, and know what you are like and who you might be attracted to. Otherwise, meeting strangers in venues where the atmosphere is sexually-charged and alcohol-fuelled runs the risk of affecting your judgement about a potential partner's compatibility and true intentions - and that includes kissing them!""

The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau released the images as part of an update on its investigation into the flight – the most expensive in aviation history.

One know-it-all answered: ""Very bad things. The fireball would have an apparent radius of over 8km, and it'd cause an earthquake measuring in the high 7s on the Richter scale.

""I assume it would wipe out any city it happened to hit.""

But another Reddit user said it may cause even greater problems.

They wrote: ""If it were to hit, there is a 71% chance it will hit water. A Tsunami would be the biggest concern.""

While user SPThirtyThree offered a detailed breakdown of what may happen.

""The diameter is 280 - 620 meters. If it were to hit Earth, it would start to break up in the atmosphere, losing some energy, so not all of that would make it to the surface.

""Global energy usage is about twice that, per year. It's 300 times more powerful that the Krakatoa volcano.

""So it would be bad, but not extinction-level bad.""

This week NASA confirmed the close fly-by, saying it will be a ""truly outstanding scientific opportunity to study the physical properties of this object"".

Dr. Lance Benner, writing for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, added: ""This is the closest approach by a known object this large until 1999 AN10 approaches within 1 lunar distance in August 2027.""

The agency said the last time an asteroid of this size zoomed this close was in July 2006.

According to the Torino Hazard Impact Scale, a zero score indicates no current threat and a 10 score suggests certain impact.

2015 TB145 currently has a hazard rating of 0 out of 10.

Yet it has been known for the scale to change quickly depending on the asteroid's gravitational pull to planets.

In recent months, many doomsday theories have emerged suggesting a number of asteroids may be about to wipe out Earth.

NASA have attempted to calm ideas of potential doom by releasing a clear statement to those concerned.

""(There) is no existing evidence that an asteroid or any other celestial object is on a trajectory that will impact Earth,"" it reads.

""In fact, not a single one of the known objects has any credible chance of hitting our planet over the next century.""","dramatic"

So the dissatisfied crowd hurl and spray drinks at the beast, antagonising it as it stalks around.

Then, retreating from a bullfighter who tries to lasso him, the huge animal sees his chance and leaps into the crowd.

People scatter before him as he ploughs into the audience, with many fleeing right onto the arena floor.

The band soon breaks out in song, trying to calm the spectators as they assess the scale of the carnage.

Four people including a child aged six were injured during the shocking incident.

A group of bullfighters managed to remove the animal from the back of the stands with the help of event organisers, then slaughtering the creature.

Published earlier this year in the scientific journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, The Kinky Women Research Study revealed that 85% of participants enjoy a good spanking and 38% enjoy knife play.

For anyone who doesn't know – knife play is a form of consensual BDSM edgeplay involving knives, daggers, and swords as a source of physical and mental stimulation.

Knives are typically used to cut away clothing, scratch the skin, remove wax after wax play, or simply provide sensual stimulation.

Shocked by the kinky results, we decided to conduct are own poll to find out what our readers get up to behind closed doors.

We asked ""What's the kinkiest thing you've ever tried?"" and the results were just as mind-blowing.

A whopping 35% of the 2832 people who took part said they have tied a partner up and spanked them.

While a shocking 7% (that's nearly 200 people) said they have experimented with blood play.

*** This many women have NEVER had an orgasm ***

This involves cutting your sexual partner or having them cut you and smearing the blood on your body and sometimes drinking the blood of your partner and vice-versa.

A further 18% said they have participated in bondage and 5% said they have enjoyed forced cross-dressing in the boudoir.

Gone are the days of texting a cheeky banana or a phallic aubergine, as Flirtmoji have launched a colourful array of schlongs.

From a veiny black member with curly pubes to a rather alarming purple penis – they've certainly created a diverse collection.

The vaginas emojis were met with much praise on Twitter yesterday, with one user saying ""Yesss! #Vagina #emojis are here, and they look rad"".

Whereas the penis images seem to be a step too far. ""You can now get a penis emoji and it’s terrifying,"" said one social media user.

While Justin Herman said: ""The birth of the penis emoji is the death of the eggplant emoji.""

As well as the five vibrant schlongs, there is also a vast array of NSFW (not suitable for work) emojis in the new range.

These include a bag of boobs, a double-ended trouser snake on a fork and a bright pink strap-on.

The designers at Flirtmoji say they spent weeks researching images on Google to come up with the final designs.

Speaking to tech website The Verge, designer Jeremy Yingling explained : ""We started looking at reference images,

""There was a lot of Google image searching for many explicit images and again, the thing that's beautiful about a particular body part is when it's not symmetrical, or it's off-angle or it's from a strange perspective.""

Sadly, Apple and Google aren't likely to include these emojis on their devices. So if you want to shock your partner you'll have to log on to Flirtmoji and copy and past them into your messages.

In fact, women are forking out for plush products to pamper their full-bodies pubes. From fur oil to muff mist, there is a whole host of new must-have products out there, designed to beautify your vajayjay.

Unsurprisingly, the new additions to our beauty bags come from New York – a city where women openly discuss their muffs.

One of the popular new products to help keep your shag-pile shiny is from a brand called Fur.

Developed by three women – 24-year-old Emily Schubert, her sister Laura and childhood friend Lillian Tung - Fur’s products are dedicated to pampering pubes.

“Few things in life are certain but pubic hair is one of them,” say the brand’s founders. “Fur is the first line of products that cares for pubic hair and skin. Our products give your pubes a chance.”

And it seems the products will be a hit in the UK as a survey reveals that 51% of British women don't trim their pubic topiary.

Celebrities are also backing the full-fuzz trend, with Gwyneth Paltrow saying she rocks a ""Seventies vibe down there,"" and Lady Gaga requesting a mannequin with full pubic hair on her recent tour.

Actress Cameron Diaz even dedicated a whole chapter in The Body Book to grooming her lady garden.

In the section titled Praise Of Pubes she goes into detail about maintaining the ""lovely curtain of pubic hair"" that ""surrounds that glorious, delicate flower of yours"".

And now you can follow in their footsteps with Fur's fuzz-loving products.

There's currently two in the line-up – there's Fur Oil, designed to soften those unruly curls and Stubble Cream, for those who aren't ready to ditch the razor.

“We shampoo and condition our hair and moisturise every other part of our body, so why don’t we treat our most sensitive area with more respect?"" said the founders.

The Fur Oil, which will soon be available in the UK, features a blend of nine natural oils including grapeseed and jojoba and will set you back $39 (£25).

Shocked Marie Martin had to swerve in the road to miss old pal Mark Murphy.

They recognised each other, got chatting and, following a two-year romance, are set to wed.

Marie and Mark last saw each other before the near miss when they were 17 and, although they were attracted to each other then, neither had the courage to ask for a date.

Over time, both moved away from Dartford, Kent, only to later return. But it seemed they were destined never to get together until the car incident in their home town.

Marie, 37, said: “I was driving to the doctor’s and as I was trying to go into a car park I went around the corner and Mark was crossing.

“It’s typical that Mark would go across the road and I would nearly knock him down.”

Mark, 37, who captains England’s deaf golf B team, proposed to Marie during a recent competition in Norway.

She cried when he got down on one knee after keeping his plans secret for months.

Marie said: “What I didn’t realise is that he had smuggled the ring in his golf bag and had it in there for about a month.

“It was a complete surprise, I can’t believe that I didn’t know anything.

“He got down on one knee and said ‘We’ve been together for a little while and you know how much I love you – will you marry me?’

“I just couldn’t believe I didn’t know. Usually I would have picked up on it but because there was so much going on I took no notice.”

Marie’s mum helped to choose their trilogy ring which represents the couple’s past, present and future.

Marie said: “We had spoken about getting married before but it was more of a general chat rather than anything serious. I didn’t think I would get engaged for at least another year.

“We’re having an engagement party in November and we’re going to Vegas so will be celebrating then – we’re not getting married there, although I think the family and everyone else would be up for it.”

From stimulating the AFE zone to stroking her 'shaft', consider this your masters in sex education.

Here are five new ways to make her orgasm:

1. Stroke her shaft

Most men hone in on just the cliterous and while it is a very pleasurable spot, the area just above can be an even hotter area for many women.

The shaft of her clitoris feels like a small cord just below the skin. If you stimulate it using your fingers or tongue the results can be orgasmic – literally.

2. Give her an AFE orgasm

The anterior fornix erogenous zone (AFE zone) has been dubbed as the second G-spot. Located on the deepest part of the front wall, the erogenous zone can lead to rapid vaginal lubrication, arousal and intense orgasms when stimulated.

Malaysian sex scientist Dr. Chua Chee Ann, who discovered the area, says that if you apply pressure and make a gentle scooping motion for at least 10 minutes a day it will make regular orgasms achievable – even without foreplay.

3. Stimulate her nipples

Some women can achieve an orgasm simply by having their breasts and nipples stimulated.

The researchers discovered that stimulation of the nipple activated an area of the brain known as the genital sensory cortex.

This is the same brain region activated by stimulation of the clitoris, vagina, and cervix. What this means is that women’s brains seem to process nipple and genital stimulation in the same way.

Even if she can't achieve orgasm this way, it will be a highly arousing experience.

4. Explore the mons

The triangle-shaped area where her public hair grows is called the mons pubis and the whole area can be extremely sensitive.

Use the heel of your hand to push into the mons while you use your fingers to play with her clit.

Also, if you think missionary is boring, think again. If you are on top, you can push down on her mons and this might just tip her over the edge.

*** The 5 best sex positions for women ***

5. Come in the back way

A position like Doggy Style is good because it puts pressure on the front wall of the vagina, which may stimulate the ultra-sensitive inner roots of her clitoris.

You are also more likely to hit the famous G-spot in what has been dubbed Britain's favourite sex position.","vulgar"

Just a single sniff of a rare fungus can make women have an instant orgasm, according to a recent study.

The work, by American scientists John Halliday and Noah Soule, was first published in 2001 but has only recently come to the attention of a wider audience.

Intrigued by this rare pleasure plant, the scientists set off to investigate.

They found that smelling the tiny orange mushroom made women orgasm first time every time.

And giving a blowjob doesn't have to be a ""job"" for her, if you makes sure she's enjoying it too.

“The more comfortable and pleasing you make it for her, the more enthusiastic she’ll be about doing it more often,” sex and marriage therapist Moushumi Ghose told Men's Health.

To make it a most pleasurable experience all round simply follow these rules of oral etiquette.

1. DO: Make her comfortable

If a woman is comfortable she will probably enjoy the act more, so be considerate of her comfort.

“If she’s on her knees, give her a pillow to kneel on, or move to the bed,” added Moushumi. “Hold her hair back if it’s getting in her mouth. Switch up positions so she doesn’t get a kink in her neck.”

2. DON'T: Push her head down

This is rule number one. If a woman is pleasuring you don't disrespect her by ramming her head down. This can strain her neck and make it difficult for her to breathe.

And lets face it she's much less likely to do it again.

3. DO: Compliment her

Everyone likes to know when they're doing a great job and this applies to sex too. Letting her know how much you're enjoying yourself is a great way to boost her confidence and enjoyment levels.

4. DON'T: Pressure her

Whatever you do don't guilt-trip her into performing fellatio. Some women just don't enjoy it.

If there is a particular reason she is put off you can talk through it, but if she's still not up for it don't pressure her.

5. DO: Warn her before you finish

Despite what you see in porn, not every woman enjoys swallowing. Make sure you warn her before you blow your load and if you want to ejaculate on her, check with her first.

If she does like going oral, she might be happy to know that a woman can burn a whopping 100 calories every half an hour from performing oral sex.

That's the equivalent of walking for 35 minutes or doing 15 hardcore minutes on the rowing machine.

If you want to ramp it up even further, Los Angeles–based sexologist Jaiya Kinzbach, recommends doing push-ups during the act or even trying out some yoga.

""You can do a little yoga,"" she told Womanday.com. ""Try plank position into downward facing dog, and back into plank where you can lower down and do some oral stimulation.""

You can blast an extra 71 calories by adding the occasional push-up and a further 35 doing some yoga moves.","vulgar"

The harrowing documentary will compound pressure on China during a visit which has already been clouded by criticism of his country's human rights record.

The documentary reveals how the activist Chen Wei is electrocuted, drugged and beaten, and even told his homosexuality was either a curse from his dead parents who were haunting him - or caused by grief over his dead pet parrot.

There are reportedly thousands of clinics containing everything from quack doctors through to exorcists in China, claiming that they can cure homosexuality and help gay men and women return to ""normal lives"".

As he undergoes the abuse, brave Chen from the capital Beijing secretly filmed what was going on.

He approached the clinic claiming that he was confused about his sexual orientation and did not understand why he was attracted to other men.

In the documentary, Chen Wei is exposed to dangerous electric shock therapy and drugs, which the clinic's doctor promised would cure his ""disease"" within three days.

Chen Wei noted that a man in charge of the clinic, who called himself Director Zhong, and a doctor named Wang Kuixing, said that his sexual preference was the result of an illness caused by ""meridian obstruction"" - a term used in traditional Chinese medicine to describe the disruption of ""life energy"" and blood flow in one's body.

The treatment for this, which has since been described as wizardry or even exorcism, involves injections of collagen into so-called ""blocked"" acupuncture points, followed up a series of religious rituals aimed at ""driving away evil spirits"" - at the cost of more than £1,000.

In a 20-by-20 room, Zhong ""murmured"" enchantments at Chen Wei and hit him on the head, back, and shoulders over 20 times.

The program also reveals that after a psychological assessment, the so-called doctors claimed his homosexuality was somehow linked with the loss of a pet parrot.

Zhong said a parent had also come back to haunt Chen Wei, and that they were ""back for revenge"" although it was not specified why.

The documentary concluded with Chen Wei unsurprisingly reporting that all efforts to ""convert"" his sexual preference were unsuccessful. On the contrary, they had left him traumatised.

The controversial clinic exposed a rarely documented underground industry of ""treatment centres"", which have reportedly tried to treat some 1,600 people for homosexuality.

They said Klein, 22, helped him clear up after he shot his stepdad in the head before killing his mother with another three bullets when she returned home from taking his twin stepbrothers to school.

Twisted Acosta admitted to the killings and said he had eaten part of his dad's flesh and had sex with the bodies.

He then cut up the remains and burnt them before feeding them to the family's six dogs.

Monica Chirivin, the woman's lawyer, said Leandro told her he felt ""an orgasmic relief"" after slaying their parents and had ""no regrets"".

The court accepted there was not enough evidence to charge her with the murder of her father Ricardo Ignacio Klein, 54, and his partner Miryam Esther Kowalczuk, 52, who was the mother of Leandro.

Klein said she was asleep at the family's home in Pilar, Buenos Aires, Argentina, when the murders took place.

She said she only agreed to help clear up because she felt he might kill her if she refused.

Police found body parts in paint pots and others were taken to a local waste site, it is believed.

Cops recovered £5,000 cash, a 9mm revolver, a rifle, a machete, three hatchets, two shovels and a pitchfork.

Prosecutor Marcelo Vaiani said the crime was motivated by a hate Acosta felt for his parents and did it so he could be left with the property and money.

But Christopher was found not guilty of two counts of murder and one of attempted murder – as she was insane at the time.

Christopher, of Colville Square, Notting Hill, London, first attacked the child who survived by strangling her and stabbing her with a plastic flower and small knife.

When Mr Brown turned up with Sophia and asked what was going on, Christopher said: ""You're one of them. You're a vampire,"" and repeatedly stabbed him in the chest.

She told the psychiatrist that at the time his eyes had changed colour and he was trying to bite her with his FANGS.

Sophia cried out ""No mummy!"" and when the defendant asked if she was ""one of them"", the little girl replied: ""Yes, I am mummy,"" so she stabbed her too.

Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors: ""After she had attacked each of them with a knife, the light bulb had told her to put something wooden into each of their chests in order to stop them from becoming vampires.""

Their bodies were found – more than a week later – after Christopher took the surviving child to hospital.

Apple boss Tim Cook has confirmed pre-orders will start on Monday October 26th, with the boxes expected to ship later in the week.

This is the fourth-generation of Apple TV and is the US firm's first new model in almost three years.

Fans can expect to see a list of improvements including a dedicated App Store and a new remote control with touchscreen capabilities.

Siri is also landing on the new box allowing users to search for content with their voice.

You can ask Siri to find movies by date, or genre – and then narrow down the results based on other criteria, ""show only movies starring Steve Coogan"", or ""Show only animated ones"".

Another clever Siri feature allows you to find content you might have missed.

If you ask the personal assistant, ""What did she just say?"" during a film or television show, Siri will skip back 15 seconds and temporarily turn-on closed captioning.

Siri can also provide information in the lower-third of the screen, including weather reports, the latest news and sports scores.

Apple has big plans for its next-gen TV box and with some major apps expected to arrive on the platform which will help increase content.

Gaming will also feature heavily on the new device and users will even be able to turn their iPhone's into mini controllers.

Apple has not confirmed UK pricing for the device, which ranges between $149 for the 32GB model and $199 for the 64GB in the United States.

That means UK customers can expect to pay somewhere between £120 to £170.

He said he planned to take her to a ""wooded area"" to ""scare her"" in a plot he ""may have got from TV"".

But when his mask slipped during the botched snatch he ""panicked"" and strangled her.

Matthews said he then bundled her into a bag, took her to his home three miles away, cut up her body using a circular power saw in the bath and recruited two pals to hide the remains.

He insisted he did it all without alerting his lover Shauna Hoare, 21.

Matthews made the written confession came on March 2 after he had been arrested for Becky's murder.

But the prosecution allege he and Hoare were a ""team"" who suffocated Becky during a joint bid to kidnap her for sex.

They claim the pair had an ""unnatural"" lust for teen girls and had plotted to snatch at least three others in the three months leading up to Becky’s death.

On Wednesday the jury at Bristol Crown Court heard Matthews described himself as a ""caveman"" when he was interviewed by police after they first arrested him on suspicion of kidnapping his stepsister.

Matthews mentioned he had ""mental health problems"" to the custody sergeant when he was booked in at a police station in Bristol.

Asked what he had meant when he said he was an ""emotionally unstable, psychologically disturbed, metrosexual Neanderthal"" he replied: ""I just Googled it (metrosexual).

""Basically in touch with my feminine side, camp, gay, that kind of thing.""

He added: ""Grumpy, a basic thinking man. Like obviously not highly intelligent. I don't know how to f**king explain specifically it.

""Just like a caveman.

""Like obviously I've got a hairy beard but that's not anything to do with it.""

When he was later arrested for Becky’s murder he gave police a prepared statement which read: ""I wanted to kidnap her to scare her and teach her a lesson.

""I believed she was selfish and believed her behaviour towards my mother was a risk to her health.""

Matthews said when Becky answered his knock on her bedroom door he was wearing a mask.

""During a short struggle my mask slipped and Rebecca was able to see my face,"" his statement said.

""I panicked and strangled her while she was partially in the bag.

""I collected the items I had used, put them and Rebecca into the bag, and zipped up the bag.""

He said he then behaved ""normally"" in front of his girlfriend and waited for her to fall asleep at their home before cutting up Becky’s body in the bath.

Explaining to police why he planned to kidnap his stepsister he said: ""I came up with the idea to scare her…like to try and basically make her more appreciative of life, like more appreciative of people, like she would be grateful that she had not been harmed.

""She would leave things out for my mum to trip over and talk to her like dirt on the floor.

""I thought if I was able to scare her and she would not be harmed when she got back she would have been scared and more appreciative of things.

""I would have stuck her in a suitcase. I would have put tape around her mouth so she would not make a noise.""

He said he planned to make an excuse to Hoare and then drive Becky to a ""wooded area"".

""I would still have the mask on and scare her and say something along the lines of, 'you have to start treating people better and not be a bitch and self-centred’, and make a threat that this could happen again or worse,"" he said.

Chinese takeaway delivery driver Matthews and Hoare both deny murder and conspiracy to kidnap.

She also denies perverting justice, preventing a lawful burial and possessing a banned weapon namely two stun guns – charges Matthews has admitted along with Becky’s manslaughter.

YouTuber BarelyHuman11 uploaded a 12-minute account claiming Robert Zemeckis' trilogy is awash with symbols predicting the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.

There's no denying the video is a slick production – but the claims are some of the most far-fetched in history.

It suggests a scene featuring the Twin Pines mall is a signifier for the Twin Towers – which collapsed after two passenger jets slammed into them.

The mall scene is the setting for a on-screen terrorist attack carried out by Jihadis in a speeding van.

But the video suggests this predicts Al Qaida terrorists perpetrating the attacks 14 years ago.

It gets even more absurd.

Doc holds stop watches to the camera, which are both stopped at 9:11, according to the conspiracy theorist.

If that wasn't crazy enough, he then claims a scene in Back to the Future II shows two pine trees morphing into the World Trade Center.

In the same scene, a character is hanging by his feet upside down.

The filmmaker claims this is a metaphor for the Twin Towers falling on that fateful day.

BarelyHuman11 says: ""This is the most literal depiction ever made showing the Twin Towers falling down.""

""I immediately prepared to deliver my 'she’s allowed to use this park just as much as you guys' speech when I heard you say, 'your feet are wrong. Can I help you?'

""You proceeded to spend almost an hour with my daughter showing her how to balance and steer, and she listened to you – a feat not attained by most adults.

""You held her hand and helped her get up when she fell down and I even heard you tell her to stay away from the rails so that she wouldn’t get hurt.

""I want you to know that I am proud that you are part of my community, and I want to thank you for being kind to my daughter, even though your friends made fun of you for it.

“You viley abused her by raping her while she was fast asleep, taking advantage of the no doubt deep slumber she was in, given the time you got to bed and the alcohol you had all enjoyed, and she was perfectly entitled to enjoy.

“Such was your inability to resist your base urges, no doubt because of the drink you had consumed, despite the apparent risks involved you continued.

These bumpers, or “tabs”, as they are being called, are powered by one or more motors and will retract and extend when the phone’s onboard sensors detect a drop.

Drops are detected by the accelerometers, gyroscopes, inertial sensors, motion sensors, and cameras present within the iPhone.

Now the social network has posted a message confirming the issues and offering an apology to users.

The problems appear to be affecting iPhone users who had updated to Apple's latest version of iOS 9.

Having run our own tests, Daily Star Online found the app sucking a significant amount of power, with 38% of the battery being eaten by Facebook.

To make matters worse, the battery drain continues to happen even when the app is not in use.

Facebook says it has now fixed some of the problems that were causing the battery drain, with the firm urging users to upgrade to the latest version of the app.

In post on Facebook, Ari Grant, engineering manager on iOS confirmed: ""We recently heard reports of some people experiencing battery issues with the Facebook iOS app and have been looking into the causes of these problems.

""We found a few key issues and have identified additional improvements, some of which are in the version of the app that was released today.""

Facebook are also keen to point out that the battery issues aren't being caused by the app snooping on your location.

""The issues we have found are not caused by the optional Location History feature in the Facebook app or anything related to location,"" added Grant.

""If you haven't opted into this feature by setting Location Access to Always and enabling Location History inside the app, then we aren't accessing your device's location in the background.

""The issues described above don't change this at all.

""We are sorry for any inconvenience this has caused. We are committed to continuing to improve the battery usage of our app and you should see improvements in the version released today.""","geeky"

The phone and internet service provider was hit by the serious cyber attack overnight.

Users are now being warned that their details may be leaked online if a deal is not made.

The company confirmed the news saying: ""Unfortunately there is a chance that some of the following data has been compromised: names, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, TalkTalk account information, credit card details and/or bank details.""

Police and leading cyber specialists are now investigating the attack which took place on Wednesday.

TalkTalk has over four million customers in the UK and the company has confirmed it is now contacting users to inform them they may be at risk.

In a statement on its website, the company's managing director Tristia Harrison said: ""We are very sorry to tell you that on Thursday 22nd October a criminal investigation was launched by the Metropolitan Police Cyber Crime Unit following a significant and sustained cyberattack on our website on Wednesday 21st October.

""We are continuing to work with leading cyber crime specialists and the Metropolitan Police to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed.

""We would like to reassure you that we take any threat to the security of our customers’ data very seriously.

""Unfortunately cyber criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated and attacks against companies which do business online are becoming more frequent.""

Clearly, many customers are deeply unhappy as this is the third time this year that the firm has been hacked.

Speaking on the BBC's Radio 5 live show, one TalkTalk user said: ""It's just the latest in a long line of failures... To hear about it up to 48 hours after something may have happened really isn't good enough.""

Whilst another added: ""I only heard about it because I happened to turn the TV on. It is very worrying.""

Twitter is also full of angry consumers, with many asking why their details weren't encrypted.

TalkTalk is now advising customers to keep an eye on their bank accounts over the next few months

If you are contacted by anyone asking you for personal data or passwords (such as for your bank account), please take all steps to check the true identity of the organisation.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/471529/HTC-One-A9-price-downfall","HTC may have just made their biggest mistake EVER","HTC's new smartphone got its grand unveiling earlier this week.

The A9 has all the look and feel of Apple's iPhone and it appears there's another feature that's almost identical – the price.

HTC has just revealed how much their shiny new smartphone is going to cost and it's definitely not one for bargain hunters.

In fact at £469.99 sim-free, the A9 is actually £10 more expensive than the original iPhone 6 and only a few pounds cheaper than Samsung's Galaxy S6.

Although HTC is confident fans will love their new device, we think they've got an uphill task with such a high price tag.

The A9 doesn't have the same high specs as its flagship rivals and there's plenty of phones that will cost you a whole lot less.

The Moto X Play and brilliant OnePlus 2 both land in your pocket for under £280 and Google's new Nexus 5X costs less than £380.

Daily Star Online had an exclusive hands-on with the A9 last week and we liked what we saw.

It feels well built and has some neat features, including Hi-Res audio playback, Android Marshmallow and a fingerprint scanner tucked inside.

However, this phone is being aimed at a new younger market and to be a success the price needs to be right.

To make matters worse the HTC is being sold in the US for under £300 and the US iteration comes with better specs.

Users across the pond will get 3GB RAM and 32GB of storage whilst the UK model only features 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage.

We'll have a full review of the HTC A9 soon, but even if this device proves to be brilliant its price could be its biggest downfall.","geeky"

Hit shows like The Walking Dead have sparked a rise in bookings for the spooky paintball and laser tag events.

People who take part are trained how to use pellet guns and do gruelling army-style training.

Over the three hour exercises, teams use laser guns to zap actors posing as bloodthirsty creatures.

There is also target practise and games where you have to shoot your opponent with a pellet before they catch you.

Events company Wish.co.uk said since starting the boot camps four years ago, it has become increasingly popular.

A spokeswoman said: ""There’s definitely been a huge rise in the love for zombies.

""People absolutely love shows like The Walking Dead and all the other zombie programmes and films that have become so popular.

""They really want to experience what they’ve seen on a screen in real life. So us being able to provide that gives them a unique experience and a form of escapism.""

She added: ""The demand was huge particularly after the likes of Simon Pegg tweeting about the Zombie Shopping Mall and we've had many celebrities come to the events too. Customers have flown across the world to attend them and they've stayed consistently popular.

""People love the concept and our zombie experiences are still the best sellers.""

And in the build up to Halloween interest in the events across the country is set to grow further for stag dos and team building exercises.

Wish.co.uk

And Wish said there have been some hilarious moments.

""When people are scared, adrenaline rushes and they go into survival mode - or fight or flight, and when someone is scared of zombies most often they will run for their lives and disown their friends.

""They get really into the moment! We've had reports of customers playing dead to avoid the zombies, or even barricading themselves in a room refusing to come out.

""On a slightly warmer and romantic note, we've also had a couple of marriage proposals take place at our zombie experiences.""

It was pitch black in an underground bunker and all we could hear was the screeching sound of screams.

We were in a group of around 20 and were given a tour of the top secret facility where we were greeted by a chained zombie in an NFL football shirt hitting out at anyone nearby.

We then saw another being having treatment in a medical room while a doctor explained the dangers of being infected and having only five minutes to get treatment. She said ""chest is best"" when it came to shooting our enemies.

The training involved being taught how to lock and load pellet guns, firing at targets and then team exercises.

Wish.co.uk

The military instructors were a no-nonsense group who barked orders and gave you the hairdryer treatment if you stepped out of line like if you removed your breathing masks.

We did a timed assault course crossing a balance beam,leaping over a wall,running between tyres and then 20 pressups.

Everyone has to wear overalls, a hood and gloves so its best to have light clothing on the day - it gets quite sweaty after three hours.

At the end we felt physically and mentally shattered from concentrating on learning how to use weapons,crawling though tunnels in the dark and looking out for baddies.

You feel like you've gone 12 rounds with a zombie.

We would have liked to do more pellet shooting games and the lack of light in the weapons room can be irritating in emergency situations you experience as you bump into each other like dodgems.

But overall, it is an exhilarating experience which is total escapism as you try to survive the apocalypse.","boorish"

Just in case you didn't read Fifty Shades – S&M means sadomasochism, a sexual practice using pain and pleasure.

The illness, called Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva affects about 800 people worldwide.

And the incurable disease has already cost Ashley her right arm. But, even though the disease can leave sufferers completely paralysed, brave Ashley has vowed to live life to the fullest.

""When I was about two and a half doctors diagnosed me with cancer,"" she said. ""They went in to remove what they thought was a tumour - and told my parents that it had spread and that my arm needed to be amputated.""

However, five months later doctors called and said cancer was a misdiagnosis and that she had a rare disease that affects one in two million people.

""I am growing a second skeleton in a sense, becoming a human statue physically,"" she said. ""Many others living with this lose all mobility, head to toe, and their jaws have locked shut.""

At 25, Ashley lost mobility in her right leg and had to learn to move around being partially paralysed.

""I don't know how much longer I will have movement in my body, so I want to experience as much as I can now,"" she said.

The condition arises from a mutation of the body's repair mechanism which causes muscles, tendons, and ligaments to convert to bone material when damaged.

Ashley, from Peachtree City, Georgia, first started experiencing the symptoms of the disease as a teenager.

She said: ""I began to feel my body stiffen gradually - I had been told it was going to happen but once I started feeling the symptoms I wanted to experience everything life had to offer before it was too late.""

Despite the fact that her body is locking up, Ashley has found time to experience all life has to offer.

""I attend many events all year round for the IFOPA, and talk to other people who are suffering.

Medics warned her parents Tracie and Mark that, should the she survive, she may grow up disabled.

But the tiny infant fought back from several heart attacks and was saved by the warmth of bubble wrap.

Hope was swaddled in the plastic wrapping to keep her tiny body warm and it ultimately saved her life.

Her mum Tracie, said: ""When I saw Hope for the first time she was so small. Doctors said because she came so early she was in a lot of danger and there was a risk she might not survive at all.

""We took it day by day. Once or twice her heart even stopped but she recovered on her own. Doctors said she was so strong, so I bought her a Superman babygro.""

Now three, she is considered above average for her age and enjoyed her first day of nursery school in September.

Little Hope arrived nearly four months early after her mum's waters leaked. Three days prior her birth, Tracie was admitted to Heartland's Hospital for monitoring.

""The doctors said my baby showed no signs of distress so I went home,"" said 32-year-old supermarket manager from Birmingham.

""But then I woke up in pain and told my fiancé, Mark, 34, to take me back to the hospital.""

There, Hope was born by emergency caesarean section.

Tracie added: ""After Hope was born they took her away to check her. Doctors said she didn't need to be ventilated as she was really strong and could breathe on her own.

""I thought: 'that's good,' but they said it was very unusual.""

To keep her warm, doctors wrapped Hope in bubble wrap and she had a line put in to feed her medication.

But when her heart stopped several times after, she recovered within seconds without their help.

Tracie said: ""Everyone called her a miracle. Hope's heart slowed down and stopped several times but while doctors tried to interfere she recovered within seconds.

""She was only on a ventilator for nine days whereas other babies born around 25 weeks tend to be on them for months.""

The doting mum was so impressed with her daughter's fighting spirit and fast recovery, she bought Hope a Superman babygro - though it didn't fit her until weeks later.

Hope weighed 4lbs 6ozs when she left the hospital and, months on, nurses doing health checks said she was healthy and above average for a premature baby.

Now, the toddler is full of energy and loves playing with older brother, Alex, five, and jumping around in muddy puddles like her favourite storybook character Peppa Pig.","boorish"

In its path is the resort city of Puerto Vallarta and the metropolis of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city.

Only a few people have been seen going to shelters in Puerto Vallarta, where 14 schools and other buildings have been set up to house evacuees.

Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio told Mexico's Radio Formula Friday morning that officials are especially worried about the safety of people in the tourist resort of Puerto Vallarta and in the nearby community of Bahia de Banderas, in Nayarit state.

Although this sounds frightening, astronomers who track near-Earth objects are actually getting excited about the rare event.

WT1190F’s re-entry will give scientists a chance to study what happens when space objects hit our atmosphere.

“Hopefully people will remember the turnip and all our other rich traditions this Halloween.”

Lucia Sciarra, played by Hollywood beauty Monica Bellucci, 51, is at the centre of the storm with producers accused of not giving her enough screen time.

“Despite what the build-up led you to believe, Bellucci’s part is in keeping with the antiquated role of the Bond girl,” said critic David Jenkins.

“Bond needs some information from her so he is straight into her bed and then straight out of it again.”

But high-speed car chases, his penchant for the odd Vodka Martini and weaponised Aston Martin means Mr Bond would NEVER get car insurance, according to Privilege.

The insurance company tasked its underwriting experts to take a look at Bond's motoring credentials to calculate a premium for the Secret Service agent and his Aston Martin.

And in summary, the firm would ""politely decline"" his application for insurance.

The company said it would have concerns for his road safety awareness as Mr Bond is often in high-speed car chases.

His cars are often kitted out in the latest weapon technology, such as ejector seats and machine guns, and even have amphibious capability.

Privilege said it would be different to ""source a like-for-life courtesy car whilst this was repaired"".

Living in an exotic location would be a problem too as the firm only calculates premiums for home addresses.

And Mr Bond's name would also prove a hurdle.

The firm said: ""Can a spy actually give us his real name? If not, he has committed insurance fraud in providing us with a false name on his application.""

Meanwhile a survey found 12 per cent on Brits put the Aston Martin in pole position as their most-loved car.

Rob Widdowfield, senior motor underwriting manager at Privilege car insurance, said: ""High-speed car chases are an essential ingredient for any Bond film.

""However, they are an insurer’s worst nightmare. An insurance application from Mr Bond is enough to leave any underwriter a bit shaken and stirred.""

Philip Jones, Aston Martin broker at allastonmartin.com said: ""James Bond has been good for Aston Martin sales, but it’s a shame he doesn’t look after his cars as well as our customers do.

""They love their cars and have had the double joy of driving them and seeing the values rise – but some need a reminder to ensure that their insurers are up to date with the value of an Aston in 2015.""","dramatic"

A model was on show at the Defence and Security Equipment International show at ExCel in London and members of the Royal Corps of Signals have put it through its paces.

Rebels including Cabinet members, senior ministers and party aides have privately blasted the Chancellor over his plan.

They reckon the move would “penalise” poor working families and leave the Tories again branded “the nasty party”.

And they lashed out over his proposal to tell working households their income will be slashed in a letter just before Christmas.

Mr Osborne is also under pressure from Labour MPs to dilute the welfare reform that would see most families £1,300 a year worse off.

The embattled Chancellor is expected to water down the cuts in a desperate bid to get them through Parliament and not lose face.

It comes as his plan is set to hit trouble in the House of Lords today when peers try to block the welfare reform.

A top Tory source last night said Osborne would move to soften the blow to families later in the week.

He revealed: “Understandably, the Chancellor does not want to lose face by acting before the issue is settled in Parliament.

“It is mainly about timing, details and costings.”

A Cabinet minister fumed: “This is hurting people. A letter before Christmas is not clever: ‘Happy Christmas, here’s £1,300 less than you thought you’d have.’”

The brave 12-year-old was born with a rare form of dwarfism and her parents were told she was unlikely to survive longer than a few days.

But the little fighter has defied medics and nealry reached her teenage years.

When she was born, tiny Kenadie weighed just 2.5lbs and measured 28cms –less than the length of a school ruler.

Her doting mum Brianne Jourdin, 36, was told to expect the worst, by the nurses who named the tiny tot 'Thumbelina'.

Doctors said she was likely to have brain damage and was not expected live, so her parents had her baptised that day.

Brianne, a funeral celebrant, said: ""Most parents don't have to imagine their kid not living past whatever age but it's a reality for us that we will probably lose her.

""We baptised her right away because we were told that we should just bring her home to die.

""It was like mourning - the idea of all of the life that you imagined for your child has suddenly been taken away.""

Eight months later, she was diagnosed with primordial dwarfism - a condition causing underdevelopment of limbs, which affects about 100 people worldwide.

But despite having learning difficulties and thin and fragile bones, Kenadie enjoys school, plays hockey and takes swimming lessons.

Weighing little over 1.5st, Kenadie, from Kitchener, Ontario, is so small that she has to wear clothes made for two year olds.

And her 10-year-old brother, Tyran, now towers over her. But none of that stops her living life to the full and she has an active social life with her school friends.

Her mum added: ""She's kind hearted, she is loving and wants to share everything with everyone. She is feisty, determined and independent.

""It makes me so proud to see her in these activities it makes me cry.

""I have cried so many times when she is on the skating rink, everything she does, I cry.""

Kenadie still faces some serious medical threats and is prone to fragile and thin bones. She also faces the danger of developing scoliosis or an aneurysm.

Brianne said: ""Having Kenadie definitely tested my faith many times - watching her struggle isn't easy.

""It's a reality we'll lose her - I lose my breath for a moment thinking about it.

""My hope for the future for Kenadie is just that she is happy and that she finds things that make her happy and make her smile.""","boorish"

The ginger-bearded bloke and his twin stranger – a mystery Londoner – noticed their uncanny likeliness immediately.

Now that the pair have become an internet sensation a third doppelganger for the fuzzy-faced strangers has turned up.

Delighted at finding each other, the cheery duo took a grinning selfie, which was posted on social media by Lee Beattie – a friend of Neil's wife.

She tweeted: ""Guy on right is the husband of my friend. Guy on left is a STRANGER he met on a flight last night!""

She later added: ""I can't stop looking at it. They are the same man.""

Rocking exactly the same hair colour and facial features, the men could pass as identical twins. Yet they are not related in any way – and it's blowing our tiny minds.

The image, which was posted on Twitter five hours ago, has already been retweeted nearly two thousand times.

And Lee's followers have also commented on the striking resemblance with a series of jokes and Parent Trap gifs.

To make matters even more freaky, the lookalikes then found a third man who resembles them on the plane.

*** These women are NOT related: Student finds identical doppelgänger living just an hour away ***

But the story doesn't end there. The 32-year-old from Glasgow and his mystery carbon copy then bumped into each other again when they both checked into the Jury's Inn Hotel in Galway.

The picture on the plane shows the two complete strangers with stunning similarities. But a later snap, of the pair having a pint in the Irish city, reveals one key difference – their height.

The photo shows Neil's doppelgänger towering over him, as they both hold their beers and smile at the camera.

Neil said: ""It happened yesterday, I work as a photographer so flew down to shoot a wedding in Galway.

""The funny thing is I went down to get my seat and he was actually sitting in it.

""I'm sure I said something along the lines of 'Hey brother' .

""He ended up sitting right next to me. It was all good fun. We had a laugh about it so I had to take the photo.""

However Neil still doesn't know the name of his lookalike.

""I don't even know his name but I know he's 35 and from London,"" Neil told the Mirror. ""He was over with his friends for a lads weekend.""

Scientists have revealed that everyone is likely to have around seven doppelgängers in the world. And it seems Neil has definitely met his match!

But he's not the only person who has randomly bumped into a mirror image. Niamh Geaney found her lookalike after launching a campaign on Facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is uncanny.

The 26-year-old TV presenter, from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest doppelgänger within 28 days.

They were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world and Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan , 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road.

The eerily similar strangers then met up in real life to take photos of their mind-blowing likeness.

And doppelgängers Ciara Murphy, from Ireland, and Cordelia Roberts, from England, found each other while studying in Germany.

The spookily-similar brunettes were both studying in the city of Breman when friends pointed out their remarkable likeness.

Ciara said: ""When I was going on nights out, people were starting to ask me did I come here with a sister, or a twin.

""I didn’t know what they were talking about in the beginning, so I was just like 'No I’m completely on my own out here'.

""But then after a while I realised they were talking about Cordelia.""

After realising they were mirror images of each other, the duo took a selfie and uploaded it to Facebook. The image went viral and has now been uploaded to Twin Strangers.","boorish"

And the pruning doesn't come cheap. In fact, keeping pubic hair in check is costing women a small fortune.

The average lady forks out £131.88 on shaving products annually and an eye-watering £225 on waxing.

And beauty products aren't the only things emptying women's bank accounts.

Just having a vagina (aka being a biological woman) means that you earn on average 19.1% less than your male counterpart.

The 2014 national statistics revealed that the average woman in the UK earns £15,400, while the average man rakes in £24,800.

That's a grand total of £9,400 less, just for being female.

And then there's the hotly debated tampon tax.

Women are spending £156 a year on sanitary items, according to Buddy Loans. That means over a lifetime the average woman will spend almost £18,450 dealing with menstruation.

Since 2000, a 5% tax has been added to sanitary products in the UK and unfortunately it looks like it's here to stay.

Other female expenses include thrush treatment, anti-itch cream and specialist appointments.

One alarming static even revealed that women are splashing £8 a month on new underwear – after period accidents.

All this means ladies are forking out a shocking £922 a year – nearly 1,000 big ones just on their vaginas.","boorish"

The 28-year-old passed out at her home in Petersfield after suffering from a bad headache and muffled hearing.

Her husband Matthew frantically called an ambulance and when medics arrived they tried to revive her at the scene – but were unsuccessful.

Colvina was then rushed to a Southampton hospital and given a 10% chance of survival, after doctors realised she had suffered an aneurism which then caused a stroke.

The expectant mum subsequently fell into a six-week coma. But despite being unconscious Colvina would often put her hands on her belly to stroke her unborn baby.

Five weeks into the coma medics had to give Colvina a c-section and her tiny baby girl was welcomed into the world at 27 weeks weighing just 3lb.

But despite her shocking entrance, the premature baby is fighting fit after being kept safe and warm in an incubator.

A week later Colvina came out of the coma and was transferred to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. A day later, baby Maia was also transferred to to be near her mum.

Hospital spokeswoman Laura Pauley said: ""The doctors, her husband Matthew and her mum spent the first few days explaining to Colvina what had happened, but she kept forgetting.""

So a few days after coming around she was taken to see baby Maia and she says she instantly knew who the baby was.

At this stage Colvina couldn't walk, talk or feed herself, but hospital staff worked hard to ensure she could spend time with her tiny newborn.

She was then transferred to the Phoenix rehabilitation ward at QA where they had to teach her to do all those everyday things again.

By the time she left hospital, brave Colvina was able to care for herself and her miracle baby.

""She was in Phoenix Rehabilitation Centre for 102 nights – which is longer than our average length stay – this was due to her severe problems on admission but also the very good progress she made with rehabilitation,"" said Laura.

Colvina, who has been out of hospital for five months, and her 10-month-old baby Maia are both doing well.","boorish"

And now the UK might be facing a national gin drought.

Middle-class drinkers will be devastated to hear that the refreshing beverage is suffering, due to a severe lack of juniper trees.

Juniper berries are one of the main ingredients in the popular spirit and without them it simply can't be made.

A new study from Plantlife revealed that juniper trees in Scotland – considered the best place in the UK to get hold of the key gin ingredient – are being killed off by a deadly plant disease.

The organisation says the juniper stash is in a ""critical state"". In fact, 79% of last year's stock is too old, damaged or dead.

However, there is light at the end of this gin-free tunnel. Thankfully, most gin producers in the UK actually source their juniper berries from other countries.

But the 39-year-old was stuck in a rut and would think nothing of indulging herself with greasy kebabs and fatty pizzas after the birth of her daughter 14 years ago.

Despite being too self conscious to wear a bikini on holiday, it took an unflattering photograph at a friend’s wedding to shock her into finally taking action.

Emma, from Stoke-On-Trent, Staffordshire, said: ""I was completely shocked when I saw it. I had no idea how big I’d gotten. My face, my arms – everything looked huge.""

""I'd live on junk food and never do any exercise.""

She threw herself into a gym routine five times a week, but the results were not as quick as she hoped.

""I’d be running on the treadmill and be very aware of people around me. I just felt like all my bits were wobbling and everyone would look,"" she said.

""Because of that, I didn’t really push myself at first. When I started to get tired, I’d just stop instead of working through it.""

Emma has now swapped fatty junk food for healthy vegetable-packed meals and has incredibly lost over 5st to achieve her dream body.

But despite managing to get down to a svelte 9st 4lb, Emma still wasn’t happy with what she saw in the mirror. She decided to talk to her husband Paul Beardmore, 42, to see if he could help.

""I figured I wasn’t going to get any fitter than I am now, so the time was right,"" she said.

""I spoke to Paul and he said he wanted to treat me to the surgery as a joint birthday, anniversary and Christmas present.""

The £8,000 operation gave her the washboard stomach she’d always dreamed of and the breast augmentation increased her cup size from an A to an ample D-cup.

""Before, I was quite a reserved person because of all the hang ups I had about my body.""

Speaking exclusively to Dailystar.co.uk, the 25-year-old spilled all about what really goes on behind closed doors at the most famous gentlemen’s club in the world.

“One guy, who paid me loads of money, he was so funny and normal,"" said the size-8 blonde, who has asked to stay anonymous.

""Then he said ‘I don’t want you to dance for me, just hit me in the balls. Just kick me in the balls’ I thought ‘I can’t do that'.

“But he paid me a good £3,000-4,000 and hee left a £2,000 tip,"" she added.

The stripper, who has seen it all in her line of work, is rarely phased by anything.

On another occasion, the Duke of Cambridge’s doppelgänger exposed himself in a bid to grab the limelight and ruin the Prince’s impending nuptials.

*** Prostitute reveals all about brothel life 'I love BDSM and kink appointments' ***

“Before William and Kate’s wedding, the guy who was Prince William’s lookalike came into the club,” she said.

“He booked me for half an hour and tried to take his pants and all of his clothes off. He tried to chase me round the club.""

She continued: “They removed him and he found me on Facebook later and apologised. I think he was trying to stir stuff up before the royal wedding.

“He ended up outside the club, chained to a lamppost, without his pants. I don’t know how. I never saw him again.”

Another wealthy customer just wanted to sweep her off her feet.

“I used to have a regular when I first started, he used to come in and rub my feet,” she revealed. “I thought 'yeah, you can pay me £400 an hour to rub my feet.’”

The erotic dancer, who began undressing five years ago to foot her rent bills in the extortionate British capital, is among many educated middle-class girls who are happier dancing for a living than slaving away in dead-end jobs.

“Because of the image stripping has people often think we're sluts, stupid, drug addicts or whores,” she said.

“Very few of the girls I know sleep around. Of the girls at work probably half have degrees and some are from top universities such as UCL, City and Royal Holloway.

“I know a girl that quit her job as a business consultant, and another who left her investment banking job. A lot of the girls have to lie and hide the job on their CV, but dancing gets you good connections,"" she said.

“A table-side dance in at the club costs £400 an hour, the girls develop very strong sales and customer service skills that would be great in some lines of work.”

She also stressed that becoming a stripper has boosted her self-esteem and made her feel more attractive in her day-to-day life.

“I was really shy before, but it boosts your confidence and you do feel sexier,” she admitted. “I really enjoy it. It’s quite glamorous. It’s like a normal night out but with a bit of nudity.

“The job has helped me out with so many different things. When I had no money and wanted to move to London, when I had no money and wanted to move out of my ex-boyfriend’s house… it’s helped me out then. I love working here,"" she added.","boorish"

First up, we bring you the most haunted pubs in Britain - and get controversial comic Dapper Laughs to test one out. Just don't order spirits...

The White Hart, Edinburgh

BACK in the early 19th Century the murderous duo William Burke and William Hare hatched a dastardly plot to get rich.

They got vulnerable people drunk in pubs such as the White Hart and then lured them to their deaths, usually by smothering them until they expired.

The pair would then sell on the corpses for dissection at medical schools.

A ghostly girl in a red dress, thought to be one of their unfortunate victims, now haunts the cellars, and one employee's hair was pulled while she was changing a barrel.

The Golden Fleece, York

THIS dimly-lit pub even has its own skeleton in one of the bars - an indication of how the 500-year-old hostelry has been linked to the macabre for centuries.

The bodies of executed criminals were once stored in the cellar and ghosts include One-Eyed Jack, who carries a flintlock pistol, and a Canadian airman who died in the pub.

He wakes guests with his icy fingers and looms over them in bed.

The Grenadier, Belgravia, London

BUILT in 1720 as an officers mess for a nearby barracks of the Grenadier Guards, this pub and its downstairs cellar are said to have been used as a drinking and gambling den for off-duty soldiers.

Legend has it that a young recruit called Cedric was caught cheating at cards, and his comrades punished him with such a savage beating that he died from his injuries.

Ever since, Cedric's ghost has been said to reside in the building, moving objects and lurking in crooked corners ready to terrorise patrons when they pop in for a pint.

The Mermaid Inn, Rye, Sussex

AT least six rooms at this 15th Century pub are haunted and spooks include everything from mysterious figures walking through walls to a ghostly woman who rearranges guests' clothing.

The Kingsmill suite is known to turn suddenly icy cold and a rocking chair moves maniacally by itself.

Other reported sightings are of strange orbs of light in bedrooms and a white lady who passes silently across the floor.

Ye Olde Man & Scythe, Bolton

THE 750-year-old bar was already thought to be haunted by a beheaded former owner, the Earl of Derby, before landlord Tony Dooley apparently caught a spectre lurking in the bar on CCTV.

The footage, from early last year, showed the mysterious figure standing in the Lancashire pub during the night despite the fact that the place was locked up.

Later the same summer a tourist shot a video showing strange flickering lights at an upstairs window. Mr Dooley says: ""My attitude before I became the manager was not to believe in ghosts."" But he adds: ""I'm convinced now.""

Red Lion, Avebury, Wiltshire

AS the only pub in Britain to be surrounded by a stone circle and which is said to stand on the crossing of two mystical ley lines, it's no surprise that the Red Lion has its fair share of supernatural goings-on.

There are believed to be at least five ghosts at work in the pub. .

The most notorious is reckoned to be the spirit of a girl named Florrie, killed by her husband after he discovered her unfaithfulness.

Florrie is thought to be the one responsible for throwing items across the bar.

Jamaica Inn, Cornwall

MADE famous in Daphne du Maurier's dark novel - recently adapted for TV - this ancient smugglers pub is located on Cornwall's lonely Bodmin Moor.

Many creepy tales surround the watering hole including one about a mysterious figure who sits on a wall opposite the pub. He's said to resemble a man who was murdered at the inn.

Another shadowy figure has been spotted moving through the restaurant, and guests have even been spooked by the spectre of a pirate in Room 4.

Schooner Hotel & Bar, Northumberland

WITH 60 different ghosts and 3,000 reported sightings in eight years, the Schooner in Alnmouth is so spooked that it has featured on TV's Most Haunted.

Room 28, the old servants' quarters, was allegedly the site of the chilling murders by a father of his wife and two children. Guests have also reported seeing a ghostly girl and boy there.

The moans of a young girl have been reported from inside a wardrobe in Room 16 while Room 17 is said to be plagued by a poltergeist.

Dapper Laughs: 'Cellar turned so eerily cold'

WE sent comic Dapper Laughs to The Grenadier in London to see how tough he really is.

""Bring it on,"" he cackles as we enter the historic building in time for last orders.

""I do believe in ghosts but I've never been spooked as such. It's good to take a girl to a scary movie because they cuddle up to you and you can act hard.""

On a trip to the cellar, Dapper - real name Daniel O'Reilly - gets a fright. He says: ""I was standing in the spot where soldier Cedric was murdered and the lights flickered and it went from warm to very, very cold.

""I definitely wouldn't want to be down there in the dark alone. It does make you think."" Suddenly the lights go out and a few punters at the front of the bar scream. When they come back on, Dan looks pale.

The next time we see him he's fleeing for the door. Bar manager Tony believes there are many spirits lurking at the pub. He says: ""I saw one myself. I was closing up at midnight when I turned around and saw a man in uniform with a long moustache.

""I thought he was a customer at first so ran around the bar to tell him we were closed.

""But when I looked again he was gone. I didn't tell anyone but the following week my deputy manager reported the exact same thing.

""I've had someone tap me on the back of the neck and furniture has moved. It sends a shiver down your spine.""

More than 100 years ago a French spiritualist suggested placing money on the ceiling as that would help the spirits leave.

Punters then started pinning banknotes above them - and it is a tradition ghost hunters have carried on ever since.","boorish"

The inoperable tumour he’s had for the last five years has grown, and doctors now say he might not make it to Christmas.

So his mum Nicole and cousin Shelly, wanted to organise an early Christmas to make sure Evan gets to celebrate one more.

But they were shocked when the whole community chipped in to make it a truly memorable celebration.

Shelly and her family launched a GoFundMe page and a Facebook event, so everyone in St. George could get involved.

The Facebook event had 3,700 people attending and a whopping $17,000 (£11,000) was donated on the fundraising page.

The generosity of friends, family and strangers meant that they were able to decorate the street with Christmas lights and trees in Evan's honour.

There was also a special Christmas meal and a festive parade for the brave little boy.

Shelly told CBC Radio’s Metro Morning: ""Evan has always had a lot of people supporting him and praying for him, but now that whole family behind [him] is just growing.

""People are reaching out that don’t live in St. George, it’s just truly amazing.

""At the end of the day, it’s all these people, their messages, the hope I’m getting from it — that’s honestly what is keeping me going.""

As the celebrations ended, one woman Ashley Agar, posted an adorable snap of Evan fast asleep.

Alongside the image, she wrote: ""Evan needed a power nap before even getting there. He truly believes today was Christmas.

""In the 5 years that Evan has been battling cancer, I have never once heard Nicole say anything negative about the card they were given in life.""

""I have only ever heard her ask for help to raise awareness for Childhood cancer, and help give these small fighters a voice,"" she added.

""We are grateful for everyone, near and far. You have all helped create a tidal wave of love, that will never be forgotten.
Merry Christmas. Xoxo""","boorish"

Towards the end of the brutal two-minute clip her cries can be clearly heard.

Local official Mohammad Zaman Azimi blamed Taliban militants for the horrifying footage, filmed in the village of Ghalmin on the outskirts of Firoz Koh, the Ghor provincial capital.

Rokhshana's 23-year-old fiancé Mohammad Gul was lashed for his supposed crime, reports say.

Radio Free Afghanistan said the couple allegedly fled their families in a bid to find a place to be married.

Unmarried girls in Afghanistan are often restricted to their home and banned from having any contact with men outside their immediate families.

Those found guilty of stoning someone to death is likely to face a long prison term under Afghan law.

Capital punishment was widely practiced by the Taliban regime between 1996 and 2001.

In Taliban-controlled areas men and women found guilty of having relationships outside marriage are sentenced to death or publicly flogged.

In 2013, the nation's government was forced to distance itself from a leaked draft law to reintroduce public stoning as a punishment for adultery.","dramatic"

But as she tucked into her Big Flavour sweet chilli chicken wrap she bit down on something tough and chewy.

She immediately spat it out and to her horror discovered the dead frog.

Fuming dad Dave believes it may have been a Halloween prank by a McDonald's worker which resulted in putting his daughter off fast food for life.

""She only had a little bit before she felt something funny in her mouth,"" he recalled.

""She spat it into her hand and said 'Ew, this is horrible. What is is?' Then she said, 'It's a frog! It's a frog!'

""I was driving down the motorway and she was freaking out. She was going to be sick. I told her not to be silly and to put it into the bag.

""Then we stopped and it was pretty obvious what it was. I phoned McDonald's. I was disgusted.""

But a spokesperson for McDonald's said it is ""extremely unlikely"" this originated from the restaurant.

However Dave, of Moreton, Merseyside, says he got practically zero sympathy following the purchase at Gateway services on the A55 near Flintshire, north Wales, on October 31.

The alarm was only raised the following evening as his dad – Wayne – assumed his son had ""struck lucky"" and gone back with a girl.

A search helicopter found his frozen body in the snow.

Kieron and Joseph visited four bars in the Alpine resort – with is popular with Brits for its lively ""apres-ski"" nightlife – drinking flavoured wine and beer.

But Kieron was still absent when he got back so he raised the alarm with the tour reps and police and a search party was launched.

By the time he was found he was already dead.

Mr Flux said: ""He was frozen solid.""

""He had gone on the shuttle bus and got off at the wrong end of town, he was disorientated and wasn't dressed warmly and subsequently got lost in the snow and developed hypothermia and died.

The murderous regime has claimed responsibly for the incident over Sinai, Egypt, on Saturday morning, where 224 people lost their lives.

And the latest video shows ISIS thugs praising the alleged downing of the Metrojet Airbus A321.

It is understood the latest propaganda video was filmed in Ninevah, Iraq, a province with a large Islamic State presence.

Footage shows sweets and leaflets are handed out by armed fighters to smiling locals at an event and as they pass in cars.

The video ends with five ISIS fighters purportedly praising the alleged downing of the flight.

A white jihadist appears and addresses the camera with an eastern European accent.

At one point during his aggressive rant he brandishes a blade as he speaks to the camera.

Investigators are probing the cause of the horror crash in the desert.

Wreckage from the Kogalymavia plane was found strewn across nine miles after the plane broke up 31,000 feet in the air.

Authorities in Egypt and Russia initally said the most likely cause of the crash was a technical fault.

But the airline said the plane was in fine condition.

ISIS claimed responsiblity for the attack.

Satellites recorded a sudden ""heat flash"" as the plane exploded – suggesting it may have been blown apart by an explosive device.

Infra red sensors on US satelites detected a burst of heat as the jet was torn apart.

""That’s it. A conversation about how much he’d love my used fetishwear to add to his collection. Again and again.”

Seductress exposes over 100 love rats online","Do you really trust your other half? Well, an undercover 'honey' gets her thrills from laying out traps to catch cheats and liars – and there are plenty of them.

Amy Wade charges just £20 a week to work as a secret agent catching unsuspecting love rats.

And so far the 28-year-old has exposed more than 100 cheats, after their paranoid partners asked her to set them up.

The blue-eyed seductress sends messages on social media luring in men to test if they're being faithful.

""I love being a honey and exposing love cheats, some of the rats I talk to are so vulgar and disgusting, it's really shocking,"" said Amy, who works in a pharmacy.

""I spoke to one rat for four weeks, at the end my client told me to ask him to meet up, he agreed, and then disturbingly told me he wanted to live out his rape fantasy with me.""

Amy, from Surrey, is given instructions on how to approach the potential cheats by her female clients.

Shocking figures from Cheatingrat.com show that 82% of clients were told that their loved ones had been overly flirty, 40% wanted to meet up and 22% asked to meet for sex – with one even offering money.

Amy said: ""One thought of himself as a Made In Chelsea type, I knew straight away that his girlfriend had something to be worried about.

""Within days he was sending me explicit snaps, he invited me round to their flat for a dirty weekend and even told me she was a 'stupid, fat idiot' when I knew she wasn't – she was stunning.

""At the end of the week, I blocked him, and sent her the evidence – I hope she kicked him to the kerb.""

Amy has only been working for Cheatingrat.com for four months, but she's already super busy – one week she had 18 clients asking her to chat to their partners.

Honeys use their own social media profiles and basic conversation starting scripts so that rats doesn't sniff them out.

""I never feel bad about breaking up relationships, clients contact me and they're usually right to be concerned, if you don't trust your man then it's my job to put your mind at ease,"" she said.

""I get a real rush the whole process, it's so exciting, even when I can see the rat typing I wonder what they're going to say next.""

Honeys are matched with people who are not from the same area. They lock off all location settings and maximise their privacy for their own safety.

Amy only ever uses social media to chat to clients' partners – honeys never meet rats in person or speak to them on the phone.

""Some men make it clear from the beginning that they are taken which is refreshing, but most jump at the opportunity to slime over a new girl in town who doesn't know anyone,"" she said.

""Being a honey is never dull, and despite speaking to so many men they never cease to amaze me.""

""I sit behind my screen cringing, you wouldn't believe the things people say, it's as though inhibitions go out of the window when somebody is behind a computer screen,"" she added.

But despite being surrounded by cheats and liars, Amy still hopes to find love in the future.

Having a few pints of the sweet nectar can actually help boost libido and help men last longer in bed.

Contrary to popular belief, Dr Kat Van Kirk claims sinking a few jars can also give them longer and more intense erections.

Beer is full of phytoestrogens from the alcohol and these are scientifically proven to delay orgasm, she told the website askmen.

The Los Angeles-based sex therapist claims that dark beers, such as porters and stouts, are particularly good at boosting sex drive.

This is because the high iron content increases the red blood cells and therefore the blood flow to the penis.

And your sex life isn't the only area that can be improved by drinking beer.

A study by Italy's Fondazione di Ricerca e Cura, found that a pint a day reduces the risk of heart disease or stroke by a third.

It suggested that drinking a few brews paired with exercise can help keep your heart healthier and give you more stamina in the bedroom too.

And it seems Guinness is your best choice, when it comes to ""healthy"" beverages as it is packed with rich vitamins and minerals.

""It can help fortify your overall health and be better on your stomach so you won't feel sluggish during sex,"" said Dr Kirk.

""I generally don't like creative male personalities, and since I'm a creative professional, I don't want to feel any competition.""

Lindsay added ""It's always weird to me when women talk about wanting a guy who plans things/surprises/etc.

""For me, I love having control over the social element of my relationship and I don't like surprises. If I can plan every dinner and holiday, that's awesome. I don't like guys who get slick with celebrations. Also, I want to pick the restaurant.""

""I don't like the feeling of someone next to me all the time, and I also need my personal space,"" said Alice. ""So far, I've only had one serious relationship where the guy was okay with that, and we dated for three years.

While you might think you know everything there is to know about safe sex, there are some topics that probably weren't discussed in sex ed.

Plus there has been a continual rise in people diagnosed with STIs in Britain. There was a whopping 440,000 diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections in England last year.

The most commonly diagnosed STI was chlamydia, with 206,774 diagnoses made in 2014. But the largest proportional increase in diagnoses between 2013 and 2014 were reported for syphilis (33%) and gonorrhoea (19%).

To help reduce your risk of STIs we've asked Brigette Bard, CEO of BioSure UK and Founder of Last Taboo, the most embarrassing sex questions – so you don't have to.

""We want to shout about sex from the rooftops. Learning from and educating each other,"" said Brigette, who helped launch the first at-home HIV test.

""This is the only way we will move closer to stemming this surge in the increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections in the UK. So let's talk about sex.""

1. Can I get a sexually transmitted infection (STI) from oral sex?

Yes and it’s pretty common – especially for gonorrhoea, genital herpes and syphilis. You can also get chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis A B & C and genital warts through oral sex, although these are less common and carry a lower risk.

To help prevent this, you or your partner can wear a condom (there are some nice flavoured ones around) or for oral sex involving the anus or female genitals you can get dental dams which are a square of very thin plastic you put over the area where your mouth is going. They also come in a variety of flavours.

2. Could I catch an STI from anal?

Penetrative anal sex whether you’re gay or straight carries a higher risk of STI’s because the tissues inside your anus are thinner and they don’t self-lubricate so can be damaged more easily.

There is a much higher risk from HIV, gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis B, herpes and HPV.

It’s even more important to use condoms if you don’t know each other’s sexual health status and always use water based lubricants as it will help stop tissue damage and prevent condom breakage.

3. What about mutual masturbation?

It depends what you are mutually masturbating with. If you’re using your hands there is not really any risk, although there is a very low risk from using your hands on someone else and then yourself – the same with sharing sex toys.

Always wash them before. But genital to genital masturbation can leave you exposed to things like herpes, HPV (genital warts), pubic lice (crabs) and syphilis.

4. And kissing – surely that's safe?

You can't get an STI, but you can pass on or get herpes (a cold sore) so avoid kissing if either of you has one.

5. Just in case the the myth IS true – can I get an STI from a toilet seat?

STI’s can’t really live outside of your body for very long so there’s not any risk – unless you’re having unprotected sex on said toilet seat!

6. Which STIs are treatable and which are with you for life?

Many STI’s (bacterial infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) are treatable with antibiotics (although ‘super’ antibiotic resistant strains are increasing).

HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and herpes (and sometimes HPV) are with you for life but there are treatments that keep them manageable. But you have to know you have an infection to get treated.

7. Can you die from an STI?

HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C can all be fatal if left untreated. They eventually cause irreparable damage to your immune system/liver, however there are really effective treatments available to prevent this damage.

There are very often no symptoms, so it is really important to get tested if you have any doubts and start treatments to protect yourself; making sure you don’t pass it on to anyone else

8. Can STIs make you infertile?

Yes, especially in women. The most common infection to cause infertility is chlamydia because over time it causes the fallopian tubes to irreparably scar and block the release of eggs.

Chlamydia usually doesn’t have any noticeable symptoms, so testing is really important. Syphilis and gonorrhoea can also adversely impact fertility.

9. Can you pass STIs on to your children?

Through normal contact it is very unlikely you can pass an STI on to your children, but herpes can be spread through kissing.

Also hepatitis B and HIV can be transmitted to an unborn child during pregnancy and there is a strong likelihood of an unborn baby contracting syphilis from the mother, especially during birth if there are any sores

10. How do you know if you've got an STI?

Some STI’s have symptoms and some do not. It’s worth getting checked at a sexual health clinic regularly, if you have unprotected sex with someone whose sexual health you don’t know, especially if it’s with more than one person as this increases your risk.

If you have any lumps, bumps, itching, pain, discharge etc from your genitals – go and get checked at your local clinic.

That way you can get any treatments you may need and avoid passing it on to someone else.

11. How often should you get a STI check?

It really depends. If you’re starting a new relationship with someone it is a good idea for you both to go and have an STI check to make sure you’re all clear – remember things like HIV, hepatitis B & C and syphilis can take up to three months to get an accurate test result.

If you’re single and sexually active, especially if you’re having sex unprotected sex or sex with multiple partners, I would advise you have a regular STI check - as often as every three months.

12. What does the STI check involve for men and women?

For a full STI screen the process is quite straight forward. A nurse will ask you a series of questions about the sort of sex you have and then take some blood samples to test for HIV and hepatitis.

You will also be asked to take one or more swabs of the inside of your genitals (for both men and women) and provide a urine sample.

The nurse might also check your throat. They’ll probably send you away with some free condoms as well! It’s nothing to be worried about - these people have heard everything you can think of and won’t make you feel embarrassed.

Most people feel relieved after visiting a sexual health clinic. Results are usually provided over the phone or via text message within a week and if anything shows up you’ll be asked to go back for a follow-up appointment.

There are loads of options for taking STI tests though, and if you really are worried but don’t want to see a doctor or nurse, you can self-test yourself at home for HIV, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and HIV.

With ladies dusting off their racy devil outfits and slipping into skin-tight cat costumes, Halloween is the perfect time to spice things up in the bedroom.

Here sex expert and Senior Hardgoods Buyer Eve Fifer from Ann Summers gives her top tips on how to make her scream this Halloween.

“Treat your partner to some fancy dress items to allow her to really get in the mood and into the Halloween spirit.

""From a naughty maid’s outfit to sexy cat ears, tap into her fantasies and find items that will make her feel confident and encourage her to dominate the bedroom, turning her on in the process.”

*** 17 sex secrets people wish they'd known earlier ***

“Sex toys are more advanced than ever, and there are plenty of remote or phone app controlled beauties available.

""Ask her to insert the love egg/jiggle balls/We Vibe before date night and take the control along to use as you please and have her quivering before the main course is even finished.

""Alternatively, if you can’t be together this Halloween, have a steamy session over Skype and ask her to show you exactly what you’re doing to her.”

“Get naked with your partner but have a kissing only rule. Alternate from slow and soft to harder, deeper and more passionate kissing.

""Drive them crazy by gently biting their lower lip, breathing hot air from your mouth into their ear and whispering what you want to do to them.

""Don’t forget to use your fingertips to massage their scalp and softly touch her from the base of her spine to the top of her back.”

“Forget snuggling up in front of a horror movie this Saturday night, instead turn off the TV and ask if she wants to watch porn together in bed.

""As things get intense onscreen, you won’t be able to keep your hands off each other.”

*** Five ways you never knew you could make her orgasm ***

“Get inspired by the porn you have enjoyed together and make yourselves the stars.

""Keep your movie safe and review it together the next time you’re getting physical; it will leave you both gasping for more.”

“Massage her whole body with sensual oil, by candlelight. When she’s fully relaxed, blindfold her and use soft ties or cuffs to restrain her hands and ankles.

""Ask her to direct you exactly where and how to touch her. If she’s keen, experiment with nipple clamps, sensation lubes and floggers to find out exactly what her body responds to. Then ask her to swap places so she can return the favour.”

“Blindfold your partner and light a massage candle about 10 minutes into foreplay - our Chocolate & Vanilla one made from soy wax smells divine!

""Drip it teasingly over her body - the wax turns to oil when poured and stays warm rather than scalding the skin.

""Wax play leaves nerve endings hyper aroused and the heat activates a small pulse of psychoactive chemicals called opioids, leaving her begging for more.”","vulgar"

But Brigette Bard, CEO of BioSure UK and Founder of Last Taboo hopes to change all that.

The sexual health expert wants to rid the UK of its embarrassment around the subject, by talking frankly about some of the nation's most intimate concerns.

She said: ""In the UK we're rubbish about openly sharing and talking about that naughty three letter word - SEX.

""We can't talk to our parents or our children about it, many struggle to discuss it with their partners and sex education in school is abysmal.

""We want everyone to feel comfortable talking about and sharing their sexual experiences.""

From anal sex to cervical cancer, here she answers all the questions you've always wanted to know but were too afraid to ask.

1. Does shaving/waxing pubic hair make it cleaner down there?

No it doesn’t. Pubic hair acts as natural protector and gives a cushion against friction and provides a natural line of defence against bacteria, especially from things like herpes.

Shaving and waxing is a fashion choice – not more hygienic. It also carries increased likelihood from things like boils and skin infections by causing small breaks in the skin in a very sensitive area.

2. How many calories are in sperm and can it make you put on weight?

You’d have to eat a lot of sperm to put on weight. A teaspoon of sperm (about the usual amount for ejaculation) contains between 5 and 25 calories, depending on the amount of protein.

3. Is anal sex 'dirty'? Can you get any disease from it?

Anal sex is not dirty. Some people worry they will get faeces (poo) on them, but faeces are held in your colon not your anus and only move down when you want to have a poo.

It can however carry a higher risk of contracting an STI, whether you’re a man or a woman, as the tissues there are pretty delicate and can be easily damaged.

There can also be a risk for a woman if you are going to have vaginal sex after anal sex, as there can be a transfer of bacteria.

It is a good idea to use a condom for the anal sex and throw it away or change it before vaginal sex as this will prevent any bacterial transfer.

4. Can you catch diseases from rimming?

Yes, you can catch diseases from rimming because however clean your bum hole is there is always going to be lots of bacteria because it is how your body works.

Bacteria such as e-coli and salmonella can be present and make you really ill if you ‘eat’ it and there is also risk of Hepatitis A.

Shigella (which causes very bad diarrhoea and cramps) is also on the increase, with the main cause being attributed to faecal/oral transmission.

There are things called dental dams, which are thin sheets of plastic or latex that are placed between the mouth and anus, that protect you from ingesting bacteria.

I have also heard of people using cling film, but a word of warning – sometimes this has tiny holes in it, which bacteria can get through, so use a double layer. Another tip – if you put some lube on the anus first it can hold the dam in place.

5. Is it normal to be sore after sex?

There are quite a few reasons you can be sore after sex, usually this is just down to friction and possibly bruising, especially if you’ve had a lot of sex in a short space of time.

It can be worth using lube for longer sessions. Thrush and cystitis (which is not an STI but can be spread through sex) are two of the most common infections that cause soreness after sex in women.

6. Is spotting normal or could it be a sign of something more serious?

Spotting (or bleeding in women between periods) is really common and usually nothing to be worried about.

It can be caused by hormonal changes, such as taking the pill. Spotting after sex is less common though and may be due to damage to the vaginal wall from friction (and possibly vaginal dryness).

If you bleed every time after vaginal sex that is more worrying and could be a sign of an STI (from lesions that bleed), or cervical or uterine cancer. If you have any concerns you should visit your GP or local sexual health clinic.

7. What should I do if I get a rash down there?

A rash can be caused by a number of different things, including shaving or waxing and even friction.

If you have any discharge, pain or burning, it is worth going to get checked and avoid any further sexual contact to prevent spreading any potential infection.

Herpes, syphilis and HPV can all cause rashes that itch but they generally look like blisters, sores and small growths, respectively.

Pubic lice (crabs) and scabies can also cause an itchy rash and it’s not uncommon to get itchy fungal infections in your nether regions. All of these things are treatable (not all are contagious) so it’s worth getting some advice if you’re worried.

8. Can you get mouth cancer from giving a woman oral sex?

HPV (human papiloma virus) is associated with cancers and it is possible to contract HPV from oral sex.

However it is really difficult to prove whether HPV can cause throat or mouth cancer – there are studies that suggest that giving oral sex to more than six women in a lifetime increase risk of oral cancers, but this is in no way comparable to the risks of smoking, drinking and stress.

9. What are the symptoms of cervical cancer?

Cervical cancer very often doesn’t have any symptoms until it is quite advanced, but the main one is usually abnormal bleeding (especially in post-menopausal women) and possibly a change in discharge where is becomes more watery and smelly.

HPV can be a precursor to cervical cancer and it is really important to know the symptoms (small growths around the genitals which can clump together to form cauliflower like clusters) Girls are now vaccinated in schools to prevent HPV infection.

10. Does having a smear test hurt? How do they do it and when should you have them done?

No, it doesn’t hurt and it’s a lot easier if you relax. It only takes about five minutes.

You lay on a bed, undressed from the waist down, put your feet together and relax your knees out to the side.

The doctor or nurse then inserts a speculum into your vagina, which holds the vaginal walls apart and they then take a sample with a swab or brush, from your cervix.

11. How often should you get a STI check?

It really depends. If you’re starting a new relationship with someone it is a good idea for you both to go and have an STI check to make sure you’re all clear – remember things like HIV, hepatitis B & C and syphilis can take up to three months to get an accurate test result.

Despite his shaved head and masculine dress sense, the 21-year-old says his body feels ""completely wrong"" because of his breasts.

He wears a binder every day and is forced to cover up in oversized t-shirts with baggy hoodies in an attempt to conceal his chest.

The NHS funds boob jobs and gender realignment surgery - but Kasey would have to wait 13 months just for an initial consultation.

So the buxom lad – who has been in a relationship with a woman for five years – has set up a Go Fund Me page in the hope of raising £5,000 to pay for a double mastectomy.

He said: ""I previously thought I was a lesbian – but in April I said out loud for the first time that I was transgender and it just felt right.

""I suddenly know what I am – but I hate my body and I can't cope with having a female chest.

""I managed to save enough money for a consultation about hormone treatment – which was £400 – but top surgery is far more expensive and would take forever.

""I hate my big boobs and I couldn't bear to wait more than a year to get rid of them.""

Kasey came out to his parents as gay when he was 15 – shortly after cutting off his long blonde hair.

As his body developed and Kasey reached a 34DD bust, he began to feel so anxious he couldn't leave the house and had to leave his customer service job with ASOS.

Kasey said: ""It was a friend who suggested the crowdfunding idea.

""I've got nothing to lose and it would be amazing to think I could have the surgery next year.""

Kasey still lives at home with parents Katie and Colin and girlfriend Shannon Pastore – who moved in with him earlier this year.

Shannon said: ""Kasey jokes that he turned me gay and now he's turned me straight again because he's transgender.

""People sometimes ask me what I am now if I was a lesbian before.

Malwarebytes' senior security researcher Jerome Segura recently spoke out to debunk the myth that visiting adult websites will put your PC at risk from malware.

Mr Segura has claimed that adult websites are often safer than many non-porn sites.

""Pornography publishers are about half the publishers we work with"" Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski has previously revealed.

""They do take security seriously – their response times [to an attack] have been significantly better than other publishers.""

The search-term 'iPhone' is more likely to result in your PC becoming infected with a computer virus than the search-term 'Viagra', Malwarebytes' Jerome Segura revealed.

Malicious advertising – dubbed malvertising – is one of the most common sources of computer viruses.

Online advertising networks use cookies and other user data to target the flash and banner adverts users see on webpages.

But unfortunately ""not all ad networks apply the same guidelines"" says Mr Segura.

""The ecosystem is very diverse and you'll see that some are pretty strict and others are not so much.

""Because they are all tied in together sometimes an [ad] impression will go through multiple parties – a particular ad impression can go through five, ten, fifteen, twenty different parties before it gets back into your browser"".

As a result – ad networks are an effective way to quickly disseminate a computer virus across the web.

Malwarebytes CEO Mr Kleczynski branded malvertising a ""very efficient delivery mechanism for malware.""

It was using this method of malware distribution that websites including DrTuber, Nuvid, Eroprofile, IcePorn and Xbabe were hit by a computer virus earlier this month.

The affected porn sites collectively attract more than 100 million visitors each month.

The pornographic sites were all infected with malicious adverts that direct users to fraudulent web pages. Ransomware is then downloaded on to a victim's machine and forces the user to pay a fine.

Ransomware works by either threatening to leak embarassing data, or locking a users' machine until the ransom is paid in full.

The latest malware scare comes weeks after a similar attack took place on PornHub and YouPorn, which posed a serious risk to the sites' 800 million users per month.

The virus was also spotted by the security team at Malwarebytes who confirmed: ""Rogue advertisers abused the ExoClick ad network by inserting a seemingly legitimate piece of code as an ad banner.""","geeky"

The new accessory features a clever battery pack which has been squeezed into the rear of the case.

This brings you extra power when the battery light glows red and you can't get near a plug.

Apple says its new case offers users up to 25 hours of extra talk time, 20 hours of HD video playback and 18 hours of web browsing.

Most cases have a simple design where first they charge the smartphone and then they charge the case.

On-screen notifications will also show you how much juice is left in both the internal iPhone battery and the Smart Case.

One of the challenges that battery cases have is that they can impact cellular performance.

However Apple says it has created something that gets the same great cellular performance of iPhone 6s by adding a passive coupled antenna into the case to minimise this impact.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/480028/Netflix-announce-extra-content-2016","Major Netflix news is going to make TV fans very happy","The online movie streaming firm is bringing telly fans a host of new content next year including a lot more original shows.

Netflix says it plans to produce 31 new original series next year, which is around double what they currently have online.

Along with these new exclusives, the firm has also announced that fans can expect 10 new feature films, 30 shows for kids, 12 documentaries and 10 comedy specials.

Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos revelaed the news at the UBS Media Conference in New York, saying what the firm has in store is ""quality stuff.""

Netflix already makes a number of original shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black.

The online streaming firm also made it's own feature film documentary called The Square, which went on to be nominated for an Academy Award.

There's no word from Netfix when its new shows will air but there could be some big names involved.

Users were recently told that prices are going up to help the firm generate this exclusive content.

In a statement, the company justified the rise saying: “To continue adding more TV shows and movies including many Netflix original titles, we are modestly raising the price for some new members in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.

“As a thank you to existing Netflix members — who aren’t already benefiting from a previous price guarantee — we will maintain their current price for a year.”

Netflix is facing increased competition from services such as Amazon Prime which charges just £8.99 per month and includes free delivery from Amazon.com.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/480003/Clearing-RAM-make-your-Apple-iPhone-instantly-faster","The simple trick that will make your Apple iPhone instantly faster","If your iPhone is feeling a little sluggish there's a very handy tip to speed things up.

With our phones jammed full of apps it doesn't take long for things to begin to creak.

Many apps run in the background of your phone, sucking the life out of it without you even realising.

You can of course double tap on the home button and swipe the apps to close them down individually, but frankly this is too much trouble for most of us to be bothered with.

Luckily, there's a very simple trick which shuts down all of the apps at once and it also clears the Random Access Memory (RAM) at the same time.

STEP 1: Press and hold the power button, which is on the the side of the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus or on the top of all older models.

STEP 2: After a few seconds you'll get the words ""slide to power off"" displayed on the screen. At this point press and hold the Home Button at the bottom of your device.

Once the RAM reset is complete you'll be taken back to your standard home screen and your phone should be faster.

It's worth noting that the impact of this reset will vary.

Apple's latest phones should easily cope with multiple apps being open at the same time, but users of older iPhones should notice a marked improvement.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/479894/Facebook-Major-Change-News-Feed","Get ready, Facebook is about to make a MAJOR change to YOUR News Feed","Facebook is tweaking its News Feed algorithm yet again.

The news comes months after the US social network firm announced plans to measure how long you spend reading posts, statuses, comments or browsing a friends' photos.

If you linger on a particular person's status, or read through the comments under a certain kind of video – Facebook will populate your timeline with similar content.

And now the Californian company is making adjustments to make it easier for social network users to ignore certain typos of posts.

Facebook has made the changes based on data collected via a series of surveys which asked users to pick between two viral stories.

The change to the News Feed was announced on the official Facebook company blog by Software Engineer Sami Tas and Data Scientist Ta Virot Chiraphadhanakul.

""The actions people take on Facebook—liking, clicking, commenting or sharing a post—are some of the main factors we consider to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed,"" the post reads.

""We’ve learned that honing in on how to value these signals helps make sure we show you the most relevant content.

""As part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed, we ask thousands of people every day to rate their experience and tell us how we can improve what they see when they check Facebook.

""People also take story surveys where they see two stories that could be in their News Feed and answer which they’d most want to see.

""We compare their answer to the order we would have put these stories in their News Feed. If the story picked is the one News Feed would have shown higher up, that’s a good sign that things are working well.

""If the story picked is the one we would have put lower down, this highlights an area for improvement.

""With this update, if a significant amount of people tell us they would prefer to see other posts more than that particular viral post, we’ll take that into account when ranking, so that viral post might show up lower in people’s feeds in the future, since it might not actually be interesting to people.""

Facebook believes the change will affect news stories about hoaxes, which usually receive a huge number of shares and comments, compared to other news stories.

Stories rated unfavourably by those surveyed by Facebook will automatically be pushed down your News Feed – even if they have a much higher number of shares and comments than other stories or user-generated posts.

But for those who do not want to leave their news curation in the hands of Facebook's algorithms, the US firm recently pushed out an update to its iOS app which returns some control over the News Feed.

“We know that ultimately you’re the only one who truly knows what is most meaningful to you,” Facebook Product Manager Jacob Frantz admitted in a company blog post.

“That is why we want to give you more ways to control what you see. Today we are announcing even better tools for you to actively shape and improve the experience.

“We’ve redesigned and expanded Facebook’s News Feed Preferences to give you more control.”

The biggest change is the ability to quickly choose pages and friends that will always appears at the top of your News Feed – so you never miss an update.

Facebook has also added a new setting to make unfollowing friends a little quicker.

The unfollow feature allows you to stay friends with someone, without ever having to see their latest photos, status updates or inane Candy Crush posts.","geeky"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/479803/Samsung-Galaxy-S7-rumour-specs-price-release-date","Samsung Galaxy S7 set to include a very cool new feature","It's been a fabulous year for Samsung with their S6 edge winning every gong going.

Now all eyes are focusing on what the Korean tech giant has in store next and rumours are suggesting the new phone will have a unique way of keeping cool.

It's thought the new Galaxy S7 could stop getting with aid of water.

This system uses tiny pipes fitted inside the device which are filled with liquid coolant.

Sony is already using this technology in its new Z5 smartphone, with two pipes and a thermal paste used to help get rid of the heat caused by the processor chugging away inside.

As smartphones get faster the processors inside create more heat and, as users of Sony's Xperia Z3+ discovered, hot phones end up shutting themselves down.

Using liquid to cool devices is around five times more effective than other methods and it also helps conserve battery life.

Other than a new way of keeping cool it's thought the S7 will feature all the usual upgrades.

These are likely to include a faster processor, better camera and improved fingerprint scanner.

Some experts have also suggested the return of the MicroSD card slot on the S7.

Samsung ditched expandable storage on its S6 and S6 edge devices but, with many of its rivals including extra space, it seems a u-turn might be on the cards.

There's no word on when Samsung will unveil its new phones but it's likely to be in the first part of 2016.

In previous years Samsung has launched its new flagship during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

This year's MWC event takes place on February 22nd so expect an S7 announcement around then.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/479794/Microsoft-Windows-Internet-Explorer-end-security-updates","Millions of Microsoft Windows users face major security issues within weeks","If you hadn't already heard the news, Microsoft's famous Internet Explorer browser is officially dead.

With the launch of Windows 10 the US tech giant killed off the old browser in favour of a new web surfing tool called Microsoft Edge.

Now Microsoft has confirmed that it won't support the ageing software anymore and wants everyone to upgrade within weeks.

This means after January 12th there will be no more security updates or patches to help users protect themselves against malicious attacks and browser vulnerabilities.

A message posted on Microsoft's support page states: ""Beginning January 12, 2016, only the most current version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical supports and security updates.

""Internet Explorer 11 is the last version of Internet Explorer, and will continue to receive security updates, compatibility fixes, and technical support on Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.""

Figures suggest that millions of people across the globe are still using older versions of IE and the software remains one of the most likely targets of hackers and attackers.

Although Microsoft's Edge browser is the default web tool on Windows 10 many users have turned their back on it.

The redesigned web tool brings a host of new features to surfing the internet including faster and easier browsing.

However, new data has revealed that Windows 10 users are sticking firmly with other browsers such as the older Internet Explorer and Google's Chrome browser which is is still the most popular choice for web fans.

According to San Francisco-based firm Quantcast Google Chrome accounts for a staggering 70% of all browser activity originating from Windows 10.

The lacklustre uptake could be due to the browser's unfinished functionality.

For example, Edge does not currently support add-ons – something Microsoft has promised to fix as soon as possible.

Sadly, for fans of Internet Explorer it looks like its time is finally up.

Without any secruity updates the software could be an ideal target for cyber crooks and the advice seems clear – upgrade to Edge as soon as possible.","geeky"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/479630/Netflix-biggest-rival-YouTube","Netflix could be about to get its biggest rival yet","YouTube is already one of the biggest videos sites in the world, but it could be about to get a whole lot bigger.

The Google-owned streaming service is believed to be looking into bringing premium content to its platform including top TV shows and blockbuster movies.

This would put it in direct competition with services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime and it could cause both a serious headache.

Executives from YouTube parent company Alphabet Inc. have met with a number of executives from studios and production companies, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal.

These meetings have revolved around licenses and pitches for new content, the US newspapers has claimed.

The lucrative on-demand market is thought to worth a jaw-dropping £16.9 billion a year with some experts caliming that figure could climb as high as £41 billion by 2019.

Google clearly would like to tap into some of this cash and with millions of users logging in to its site everyday it could be the ultimate platform for on-demand content.

Netflix has come under fire recently for raising prices and ditching some of its content.

Amazon Prime is also causing problems for Netflix with exclusive shows including the new Top Gear spin-off coming soon.

Disney recently launched its dedicated on-demand app called DisneyLife.

Available online and via a unique app, DisneyLife allows users to stream its library of classics for £9.99 per month.

This price allows up to six family members to watch content on different devices.

It's certinly becoming a crowed market, but hopefully this competition will be great news for consumers.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/480117/Ellen-Lietzow-anorexia-eating-disorder-recovery-vegan","Anorexic teen nearly died after cutting out food AND water in bid to be popular","Ellen Lietzow, 19, has opened up about her incredible recovery after being just hours away from death at the height of her eating disorder.

Two years ago the pretty blonde began to spiral out of control because she thought that being skinny would make her popular.

After a week of fasting, which saw her refuse to let even a drop of water touch her lips, Ellen collapsed with a seizure and was rushed to hospital.

She was in such a serious condition that doctors and nurses were astonished she was still alive.

As a young girl Ellen was bullied by kids at school even though she was just a few pounds overweight.

They would kick and push her, cruelly chanting “fat whale” as she walked through the playground.

Ellen joined the swimming team and began a strenuous training schedule spending six hours a day in the pool, which meant she lost some of her extra weight and made loads of new friends.

Although she reached the Olympic swimming trails at the tender age of 15, Ellen decided to sacrifice the sport to focus on school and her social life.

She said: ""I wanted to stay skinny just to be accepted by everyone. I had gained so many friends when I lost weight accidentally during my swimming and everyone would compliment me.

""I thought, if I quit swimming I am going to have to keep that low weight so that people would still want to be my friends, because if I gain weight no one would want to be my friend anymore.""

*** Heart attack at 17: Anorexic teen drops to 4st 8lbs after exercising 12 hours every day ***

She began to overcompensate for giving up swimming by working out for two hours before school and going on long hikes near her home.

But then Ellen changed her diet too. She started to eat just fish and vegetables, but as her disorder worsened she would eat only steamed cabbage and just the skin of an apple.

Her weight plummeted over 2st in the space of just two months and she was hospitalised for the first time weighing just 5.5st.

Then Ellen’s family and friends begged her to gain weight and she started to binge on tubs of icing, slabs of chocolate, boxes of doughnuts and huge wedges of cake.

""I was punishing my body, I didn't want to put on weight but my family and friends were so angry and frustrated,” Ellen said.

""I hated how I felt. I felt disgusting, gluttonous. It was just gross. I hated the way I looked and I wouldn't leave the house.

""I ballooned to 12.4st and felt so sick with myself I decided last year to lose it all again.”

Ellen’s “healthy eating” turned into just eating a salad or steamed cabbage for dinner, covered in salt.

“Then I cut out food completely,” she said.

In just a few months the youngster lost almost 7st and was so zapped of energy she could barely get out of bed.

The damage she was doing to her body was shocking. Her toes and fingers lost all circulation causing her nails to blacken and snap off.

Her long blonde hair fell out in big clumps, her periods stopped and she became so thin her hips and ribs jutted out from under her skin.

""My body was giving me warning signs that what I was doing was killing me. I needed to stop,"" Ellen said.

But she was still so obsessed with losing weight that she cut out all food and drink completely for one whole week.

Finally giving in to her thirst, Ellen went to the bathroom and filled a glass of water. After just one sip her body started to convulse and she suffered a seizure.

She collapsed on the floor and awoke later with shards of glass and water around her. It was then she realised she needed help.

""I just had no energy anymore,” Ellen said. “I knew I was dying.""

She finally confessed everything to her mother Madonna and she rushed her to hospital.

Ellen was immediately admitted and doctors found her liver and kidneys had gone into failure.

After the shocking health scare, she realised she needed to make a permanent change and became a vegan.

Now recovered, Ellen’s typical day includes two papayas, four apples, four kiwis and five bananas for breakfast, two sweet potatoes with avocado salsa for lunch and Thai curry soup and at least one baked potato for dinner.

Ellen said: ""My life has changed since my recovery. I'm now social, I go out with friends and I don't isolate myself.

""I try inspire others through my Instagram and YouTube with my vegan lifestyle.

""A message I have for those suffering with anorexia at the moment is that only you can save yourself. You have to make the change to choose life.""","boorish"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/480073/Andy-Jones-SAS-training-test","Hero or zero: Starman takes the who dares wins test","I'm lashing myself SAS-style under the eagle eyes of Foxy and Olly - heroes of the breakout TV series SAS: Who Dares Wins.

Am I tough enough to take on the SAS train-Am I tough enough to take on the SAS training our troops endure day in, day out? Hell no.

As my arms sag and give way under my weight at only 4pm on the first day, Olly is keen to tell me so. He barks: ""Come on, there's more in there - pull it all out.""

The only thing coming out at the moment is my breakfast, yet amazingly these endless marches around Kent's hilly countryside are only a tiny taste of the SAS drill experience.

Far from just beasting us civilians into the floor to break us, Olly and Foxy - both ex-Special Boat Service officers who have faced down death in hostage releases, drug busts and even child prostitution rings - are keen to showcase all the unique skills they have learned in their boot camp, SAS Break Point.

In a short weekend, you can try your hand at training with our troops.

This includes a timed pack march, boot camp workouts, bushcraft skills and - as seen on the Channel 4 TV show - a punishing escape and evasion exercise against the clock.

You spend the weekend living outside in a tent, making your own fires and munching on freeze-dried rations.

In a bid to keep some of the content secret for SAS Break Point devotees, I am only allowed to take part in the first day of the camp.

Olly says: ""You'll face exercises like retrieving an agent and getting them out of the area using map reading. Your movements can be compromised at any time - we really look to test people.""

Punishments - sorry ""training exercises"" - start at first light when campers are dragged out of bed for a PT session before undertaking special services exercises such as locating an agent and bringing them back to base.

Olly says: ""The moment they arrive in the car park people are assessed and asked to recall details, make decisions and be stripped of all their usual tech comforts.

""It makes people switch on. This course is never about who's the fastest, who's the strongest - it's who can lead a group. We don't want someone who cuts corners. You've got to show you can do things methodically.""

Back at base - a wooden hut and a few billowing tents - we're being talked through our rations. I'm starving but Foxy is less excited about his Army supplies - probably because he has spent his life surviving on them. ""The worst place I've eaten these? Probably my own worst place I've eaten these? Probably my own flat when I was broke,"" he says, downplaying the dangers he has seen.

To the horror of my hungry belly, Foxy throws out half of his stash. ""Salted peanuts? They're out. On missions you take all rubbish away with you so you can't be tracked.

""I also bin the rice. You find - before missions - grown men swapping packets with each other to get what they want.""

Such unique insights into Army life are what attendees are here for, though don't assume the camp is for meatheads only.

Olly says: ""On our first course we had doctors, brickies, plumbers, office workers. We had a guy aged 60 and we had at least half a dozen girls - some of those were among the strongest there. They were very impressive.

""It's about a diverse range of people. That's what the Army is all about.""

Olly and Foxy - who never give their full names either on the TV show or in real life because of their security background - first met in 1994 working in the SBS and having met up again a few years ago, started about setting up this survival camp.

Keen to give something back to the Armed Forces, they employ ex-servicemen who suffer with PTSD and work with agencies including Rock 2 Recovery (rock2recovery.co.uk) on their courses, as well as donating 10% of all profits to such charities.

Olly says: ""When these men are spat out the other end they lose everything with the flick of a switch.

""It helps these lads get back on the horse, gives them structure and puts them into successful outcomes.""

On the back of their new profile, Olly and Foxy are hoping to branch SAS Break Point into other ventures - including a ""Commando Academy"" for troubled adolescents and an extreme special forces course - an all-day sweat-a-thon, starting at 6am and ending at 6pm.

And what is the reward for the hardy few who dare take on the SAS Break Point challenge? Washing up, by the sounds of it.

A disgusted Olly reveals: ""After dinner we found mess tins in the bin - they hadn't realised they needed to reuse and wash them up afterwards!""

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/480045/porn-teenager-addicted-sexual-assault-relationships-hardcore","Addicted to porn: Teen tells shocking story of how she became hooked aged just eight","The woman, known only as Rebecca, says she “lost control” of her sexuality during the 11-year addiction.

The 19-year-old says it all began when she watched film showing a young girl being kidnapped and was confused by the “deep feeling” it brought.

Rebecca said: “When I first started watching porn, I would just watch kind of I guess ‘normal’ or ‘vanilla’ porn, just heterosexual, just run of the mill.

“And then as I got older it started becoming more violent, more aggressive and demeaning, I guess. I would watch it kind of multiple times a day and I felt like I couldn’t stop.

“I think I definitely lost control of my sexuality watching the really violent porn and things like bestiality.”

She says the hardcore porn led to her being involved in a number of abusive relationships.

It led to her asking partners to choke her - something they were “always more than willing to do”.

She also revealed she has been sexually assaulted “several times” by savage partners.

She added: “Looking back now, a 16-year-old shouldn’t have been engaging in really violent sex where there wasn’t a huge amount of respect or love involved.

“Retrospectively I wish I’d never seen it.”

Rebecca is still struggling against the addiction and visits a psychologist in the hope she will eventually be able to be part of a normal sexual relationship.

She said: “I just would like to have a respectful, equal relationship.

“And a life where I feel good about myself and my sexuality and I can engage in sex in a really healthy, respectful way.”","boorish"

But the 22-year-old award-winning gymnast, known as the Human Giraffe, was flabbergasted when a stalker superfan approached her via social media with one very bizarre request.

Speaking exclusively to Dailystar.co.uk, Beth said: “You do get strange people who like to drop you a message on Facebook every so often.

“I once had a guy message me and tell me that he’d like to wrap me in cling film in a contortion pose. I didn’t get back to that one.”

It’s easy to see how the Leeds-born beauty has amassed such a dedicated fanbase ­– which also includes a “special German fan” called Stefan who messages her annually.

The talented brunette first became an internet sensation after an image of her contorting while camouflaged as a giraffe went viral overnight.

Racking up 100,000 hits in just three days, Beth’s lithe figure was made to look like the African animal by talented body-painting pal Emma Fay – creating a classic double take snap that online fiends couldn’t get enough of.

Bendy Beth’s mind-boggling talents have seen her travel the world flexing her body in a giant martini glass on stage with the likes of Skrillex and Annie Mac, and her eye-popping line of work isn’t always so glamorous.

The acrobatics star said: “It varies, you could be working at some little nightclub in a town that no-one has ever heard of, then the next minute you could be performing in front of celebrities at a big high-profile event abroad somewhere.""

“When you’re stilt-walking you can get some drunken idiots,"" she said. “It’s usually more the ladies who like to grab a bit of ass.""

""They think because they are women too that you aren’t going to be bothered. It can get a little frustrating at times,"" she added.

But it was drenching the stage white fluid while storming a freakshow club that left a lasting impression.

She said: “I was in this quite a quirky club so I saw some very weird things go on.

""There was a performer who pierced himself with needles, then stuck candles to the needles and danced around singing happy birthday to himself.

“They also have little guys that they dress up as babies and then a drummer will bang on their heads pretending to play the drums.""

She continued: “I did a show there with another gymnast. We did a Dubstep version of The Aristocats’ Everybody Wants To Be A Cat.

""We did a duo contortion routine while dressed as cats, and at the end we had to pour milk everywhere.

The schoolboy was diagnosed with a condition called chiari malformation when he was four – meaning lower parts of his brain had been pushed into his spinal chord.

But this year the brave nine-year-old, from Hexthorpe, South Yorkshire, has had nine operations and spent 20 hours in surgery to cure the painful condition.

He had an operation to remove a bone at the back of his skull, relieving pressure on his brain, in January this year.

But a number of complications saw him rushed into theatre nine times during his six week stay at Sheffield Children's Hospital.

Now he is back home, back at school and back to his chatty self. And he is excited about celebrating his first healthy Christmas with his head intact.

""From the moment he was allowed home, all he's talked about is being able to fundraise and help other poorly boys and girls,"" said Kai's mum Michele Boardman, 46, also mum to Katrina, 24, Tamzin, 12 and Laila, 10.

""Now he is looking forward to a marvellous Christmas.""

She continued: ""He's not completely healthy but much better than what he was. Compared to a year ago, he is brilliant.

""The amount of surgery he went through must have been so tough, but he never stopped smiling.

""He'd watch Mamma Mia every day in his hospital bed, singing along to all the songs. All the staff would laugh because he had his headphones plugged in and didn't realise how loudly he was singing.""

Doctors initially said they would not operate unless the affects became life-threatening, but when his condition began to deteriorate in 2014 and he began to develop headaches, pins and needles and became sleepy, concerned Michele requested an MRI scan.

Results revealed a build up of pressure on his brain, and doctors decided surgery was necessary after all.

""He got to the point where his brain couldn't drain fluid,"" said Michele, who is a full-time carer for her son.

""He also suffers problems with his balance, but he doesn't let it bother him. Every time he falls down he gets right back up again.

""His friends at school even brought in bandages for him in case he had any knocks,"" she added.

To thank Sheffield Children's Hospital for their support, Kai decided to do a sponsored 24-hour silence.

The schoolboy, who has also raised thousands in the past, managed to accumulate £465 for the testing task.

""He really is my miracle,"" his mum said. ""I can't believe how far he has come on in a year.""

Cheryl Davidson, community fundraiser at The Children's Hospital Charity said: ""Kai is an ongoing and amazing supporter of ours, and we are so grateful for everything he has done and continues to do.

""We need as many people as possible to join Kai, sign up for Make it Better Day and raise money to transform our amazing hospital.""","boorish"

Sparky Darren, 32, who runs North East Electricals, has been in the wiring business since he left school 16 years ago.

During a hotly-contested final at Wembley stadium, it was his hard graft and attention to customer care which gave him the victory.

The Geordie admits it was a major surprise when he found out he had won the contest, run in conjunction with Screwfix.

“At the final we were told that if a lady called it would mean that I’d not won, and if John Mewett from Screwfix phoned me, I was a winner,” he says.

“So, when the lady from Screwfix phoned I just assumed I’d lost. Then she handed the phone over to John and I was in complete shock when he confirmed I had won the top title!

“I thought my interview went terribly. I thought I stuttered and barely made any sense. “It seemed over so quickly so I assumed it had gone badly and I had no chance of winning.”

Darren, who is married to childhood sweetheart Nichola, 32 and has two children, Amelie, three, and Dexter, two, showed he was prepared to go the extra mile to give customer satisfaction.

And his after-care service starts before he’s even picked up a screwdriver. Darren, who has never had a customer complaint and is the top-rated electrician on Checkatrade in his area, says: “I’m extremely tidy when I’m in someone else’s house. I knock on the door with shoe bags already on my feet so I don’t get any dirt anywhere and then I try to leave the property as tidy as possible so the customer isn’t left with a mess.

“I even bring a bag of Polyfilla with me so I can cover any holes I make in the walls. Trust and honesty are the main values for me.”

Darren also impressed with his innovative way of spreading the word about his company. When starting out, he printed out adverts on beer mats and left them in the local pubs.

The big-hearted electrician also doesn’t shy away from helping his customers in their hour of need.

He adds: “A few years ago we had terrible snow. This elderly lady rang me and said she was snowed in and she had no power.

“I checked where she was and she was only a few streets away so I got my snow boots on, walked round there with my tool box and helped her out for free.

“She loaded me up with biscuits so that was enough! I don’t mind doing extra bits for customers. Taking an elderly lady to the shops is something else I’ve done before.

It’s rare these days for a Geordie to win a big final. “I’ve now had more success at Wembley this century than Newcastle United!” quips Darren.

“She only truly believed me when she saw Screwfix announce it on their Facebook page.” In a desperately tight contest, two other candidates were highly commended – Maarc Deeley, 44 (top row, second left), of D&M Electrical Solutions, Dudley, West Mids, and Alec Calderbank, 36 (bottom row, centre), who runs Calderbank Plumbing in Bolton, Gtr Manchester.

And as a testament to the quality of the opposition, Darren says any one of the competitors would have made a worthy champion.

He adds: “It’s even more of an honour to win because all the blokes I met at Wembley were really canny lads. Great at their jobs and good company.

I even went out with one to Nando’s after the judging had finished! “We all work hard seven days a week, trying to do a job for customers.

It’s brilliant we’re recognised by Screwfix.” Now he has the title which every brickie, chippie and tradesperson across the UK wants, Darren can drive the van to go with it.

He says: “I’ve been showing the kids pictures of the new van and they are so excited about it. It’s got quite a few gadgets in it.

It’s almost too good. “My current van has warning lights on the dashboard and it needs servicing. I can’t wait to see my new ride at work!” John Mewett, marketing director at Screwfix, says: “We were overwhelmed by the high standard of work completed by the nation’s tradespeople.

“Darren showed real graft and determination when he first set up his business and really impressed us with the clever ways in which he spread the word about his own company.

“We felt that his entrepreneurial spirit really stood out and the fact that he has never had a customer complaint is a reflection on the quality of his workmanship. Darren truly represents all that is great about the UK’s tradespeople.”","boorish"

So, before throwing myself on the mercy of crafty card sharks, I took up the generous offer of a lesson from pro player Paul Zimbler, who has 20 years of experience.

After some crucial advice about which hands to play and which to fold (and how to put on my best poker face), he reveals how he got into the business.

“I started playing in casinos as soon as I turned 18 and was making good money from it,” he says.

“I was also working in real estate but was annoyed that such a big part of my pay cheque went to the taxman each month, so I packed it in when I was 22 and took up poker full time.

“My girlfriend always asks me when I’m going to get a ‘real job’ but she knows I need the buzz.”

As the 3,000-strong tournament kicks off, there’s even a celeb player in the shape of loaded Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing – who, of course, is taking part in the high-roller side event which has a £1,000 buy-in.

He says: “It’s so much fun; you get to hang out with different people and have a good time.

“And it’s at Stamford Bridge, which is kind of cool as a Chelsea fan.

“I don’t really like casinos; I find them dingy and dark, so to have it at a football stadium is great.”

So can I transform from novice to champion thanks to my newly-honed gambling skills?

Sitting around the table with seven strangers, my first mission is to make sure I’m not the first one knocked out.

I take Paul’s advice and made sure I bide my time in the first few hands, despite my adrenaline-fuelled temptation to go all in.

Then, I get handed two aces by the dealer and decide to take my chance.

Eventually it ends up just me and one other player.

Eyeing each other across the table, my heart feels like it’s going to explode out of my chest.

The croupier puts down the final card – a third ace.

My eyes feel like they’re about to pop out of my head but I remember my poker face and stay cool – it’s time to bet big.

I push half my chips on to the table and call my enemy’s bluff. Seconds later a huge haul of chips is nudged towards me and I carefully count my stack as I revel in a big win.

But sadly that’s as good as it gets.

Within two hours I’m left to reflect on a crushing defeat.

My loss paves the way for Sunil Mistri, 33, a telephone engineer from Kettering, Northants, to scoop the top prize.

He’s so chuffed with his win that he’s even planning to enter the next tournament at Manchester United’s Old Trafford home next month.

He says: “The £35,000 will come in handy – I am going to have a good Christmas. I’m looking forward to making it a double win in January.”

PartyPoker is putting on the extravaganza with Dusk Till Dawn Casino in Nottingham.

Jamie Moniz, the director of the Grand Prix Poker Tour, says: “We want to bring poker to the people at some of the most iconic stadiums in the country.”

But the hot 22-year-old is sick of people wrongly judging her due to her plastic-fantastic style.

The multi-lingual student speaks four languages and is working towards her PHD in psychology, yet people instantly brand her as ""thick"".

""For years, I was terrified of doing the Barbie look because I thought people would make fun of me,"" she said.

""But for me when I'm look fake, I feel more like me than I ever have been in my life. This is how I like to look. It may not be natural but it's 'me'.""

But Ashton didn't always look like a living doll. At the age of 16, the mousy-brown teen decided to revamp her look and started styling herself like a Barbie doll.

To emulate the look, she dyes her hair blonde, applies fake tan, undergoes lip fillers and wears contouring make-up, false eyelashes, hair extensions and coloured contact lenses.

Although Ashton, from Knoxville, Tennessee, feels happier and more confident as a Barbie, people are quick to judge her on appearance.

The Clinical Psychology Research Assistant said: ""People are always so taken back when they meet me because I don't fit into the stereotypical mould they've placed me in because of my 'artificial' appearance.

""They expect me to be an airhead or shallow.""

Ashton has gained a considerable online following through her inventive make-up tips and extraordinary before-and-after photos.

And she hopes to challenge the Barbie stereotype. She continued: ""There are so many individuals who believe that you can't be a successful academic whilst also dedicating time to your appearance.

""I want to show that it is possible. Make-up is an art and looking like a Barbie is just one of my many interests.""

As a child, Ashton – who speaks Norwegian, Persian and Spanish as well as her native English – suffered from acute shyness.

Ashton says: ""Growing up, I was extraordinarily shy. But when I was around 14-years-old, I came across a book about Theatrical Make-up.

""I was fascinated with all the methods and materials that can be used to transform a face.

""I had always associated the 'Barbie look' with confidence and being so painfully shy, the possibility of feeling confident and beautiful was very appealing.""

At first, Ashton was nervous about wearing make-up in public and feared that her classmates would mock her appearance.

""I was terrified that my classmates would poke fun at me and that I would not be taken seriously,"" she said. ""But each year, I started to care less and less about what people thought.""

Despite a huge backlash from her peers, Ashton went on to excel in her studies, gaining a place on the Psychology course at University of Tennessee.

""I got a lot of people telling me that I looked fake and that I should look more natural,"" she said.

""But pursuing the Barbie look improved my life massively. With all the criticism, I've developed a thick skin when it comes to my appearance.""

""Most people will look at me and think I'm an airhead or shallow and materialistic,"" she added. ""It's quite entertaining to be underestimated though.""

Three years ago, Ashton started a blog about the Barbie look and it gained a large following.

Fans of her tumblr page regularly praise Ashton's make-up skills and the images showing her incredible transformation has gone viral. A

Ashton – who is single – explains: ""When I started my blog in 2012, it was originally just an archive of photos of girls that I personally found aesthetically inspiring. For instance, I really like the way Kylie Jenner is doing the Barbie look.

""I feel comfortable in my skin. And I'm not afraid of showing my 'before' photos because I really do take pride in it. Make-up is an art.

""The comments I get on the blog are overwhelming positive and I so thankful for my followers. And when someone makes a rude comment on my photos, I make sure to let them know that my make-up isn't for them. It's for me.""","boorish"

And finally she predicted the establishment of a terror-led state by 2043 established around Rome.

The bizarre moment occurred as Carlos helped present the morning news on a Teleceiba channel programme called Primera Edicion - 'First Edition' in English.

He interrupted colleague Pablo Zapata as he read out a message from a viewer, telling him with an anguished look on his face: ""Look, look, did you see the glass that moved over there?

And one offered a scientific explanation for the spooky sequence of events, claiming the condensation of the water in the glass may have worked as a lubricant and pushed it across the table.

But another insisted she had seen a ghost move across her TV screen moments before the glass slid across the table.

And Carlos deepened the mystery last night by revealing production staff were not behind what had happened and admitting he was concerned.

He said: ""I felt something strange in my body. The action didn't just demonstrate itself in the glass but in me as well.

He also said that Western businesses will have no idea that the items contain material from Syria, as the cotton changes hands and locations several times after leaving Turkey.

""Despite assurances and declarations of intent of the producers, it is impossible to identify all stakeholders involved as this cotton changes owners and locations multiple times.""

Mr Santi believes that cotton sold to line the pockets of terrorists is ending up on high streets throughout Europe, the UK and the West.

This means garments and Christmas presents bought here could indirectly line the pockets of the evil jihadis.

Cotton production has declined because of the ongoing war in Syria, while its produce amounts to only five per cent of the Turkish cotton trade, Tribune de Geneve has previously reported.

He added that the cotton sales bolster ISIS' daily income from oil revenues, which is about £1.66m.

Russia also believes the terrorist group is raking in cash by trafficking heroin from Afghanistan, already coining $1bn a year.

The claims from Mr Santi come amid a huge row between Russia and Turkey, sparked by the downing of a Moscow jet by Turkish forces.

Vladimir Putin claims that Turkey is profiting by smuggling ISIS oil through its territory, something President Recep Erdogan has categorically denied, describing the terror group as an ""enemy"".

Today he said: ""ISIS is a disgrace. It puts my religion in a bad light. They don't represent Islam and I do not consider them to be Muslims.""

Forecasters warn Storm Desmond is the beginning of weeks of chaos which threaten to bring the country to a standstill over Christmas and New Year.

Experts fear that more people will perish in the conditions as police confirmed a body was pulled out of the River Kent in Kendal yesterday.

Families in Scotland and northern England, whose homes were gutted by the deluge, face another seven inches of rain in the next 24 hours.

Many put on a brave face as they picked up the pieces at their flooded homes, but some said it could take more than six months to move back into their properties.

As Carlisle remained under water, homeowners lugged suitcases of salvaged belongings through the floods.

Destroyed Cars were seen floating down streets while an army of volunteers rallied around stricken businesses and families to help clean up debris that had destroyed shops and homes. Fire-fighters worked round the clock carrying people, and animals, to safety.

In Killorglin, Ireland, an animal charity and rowing club saved a donkey that was drowning in a river.

Cumbria police sent extra officers out over fears shops will be looted. More than 100 flood alerts were still in place yesterday as the Met Offi ce confirmed Storm Desmond broke two records.

The rapid change of the size of the ballerina's breasts was vividly discussed under the picture, with parties dividing in two camps: breast implants and gaining weight.

The former star was kicked out of the Bolshoi Ballet Theatre in 2003 for allegedly being too fat but was later re-instated after a legal battle, as she only weighed 7.5 stone.

Social commentators joked that it had happened because Volochkova, at 5 ft 7 ins, was always too tall to be a ballerina.

If you think your partner is pretending to reach the big-O during your steamy romps, here are some sure-fire signs that will give away whether she’s really climaxing or not.

Basically her body will give it away. Firstly her face and chest will get hot and flushed and she’ll start to breathe quicker and heavier.

*** How to give her the BEST oral sex of her life ***

As she’s reaching climax her body temperate and heart rate will begin to soar.

Next all of the muscles in her body will start to tense up – including her vagina – and she’ll probably close her eyes.

“When a woman’s aroused, blood engorges her vulva, her vaginal lips swell, she lubricates and when she orgasms her vagina pulsates,” Tammy told Men’s Fitness.

Shockingly your lover’s vagina will actually contract between 10-15 times as she gets her sexual release but each one only lasts a fraction of a second.

To recognise when it’s just an Oscar-worthy performance, look out for porn-inspired screaming and thrashing – or just ask her.

But why are women acting out their sexual pleasure?

Most girls will want to please their partner and boost their ego but it’s also worth remembering that it can be difficult for women to climax from penetration alone.

So be patient with her and make sure you treat her to lots of foreplay.

*** This is why men REALLY finish so fast during first-time sex ***

Tammy said: “Because they’re afraid or don’t know how to tell their partners what they need to achieve a real orgasm.

“Most women need direct clitoral stimulation for anywhere from seven to 45 minutes, and unless she gives you hints like sighs and moans, you won’t know if you’re even in the ballpark.”","vulgar"

Hosted by Club Hermione, the intimate events typically see 20 couples and 10 single women gather to explore their sexuality and live out their wildest fantasies.

Speaking exclusively to Dailystar.co.uk, one of the club’s top secret employees spilled all about what goes on behind closed doors at London’s kinkiest parties.

“You can expect to find a beautiful elegant venue, sexy people, champagne reception, welcoming hosts and playrooms that open after the reception,” the source revealed.

“At the receptions we invite speakers on various topics such as tantric sex, BDSM, sex therapists and teachers.""

“At 10.30pm ladies strip down to lingerie and guys take their shirts off,"" he added.

“We offer a safe and secure environment for individuals to explore the deepest limits of their sexuality and smash the bricks society has placed over our backs.”

Manned by security, who “unfortunately for the guests don’t partake in the fun”, members have to hand over cameras and mobile phones at the door to maintain the utmost discretion.

Condoms are laid out in each “playroom” to encourage men to wrap up, but unlike other London sex parties, Club Hermione is not necessarily part of the fetish or BDSM scene.

“Guests can play in any way they like,” the insider said. “Our clientele are beautiful young professionals, to more mature couples and singles, who are not necessarily into fetish but want to experiment with others or simply spice up their sex lives.

“We are a no gimmicks, no masks sex party. Our direction is really focused on empowering women, opening people minds up, and the promotion of a sex-positive culture.”

From its humble beginning as a few frisky friends hosting private orgies, the club has acquired a cult following and now boasts a mailing list of 4,000 worldwide and hosts events in Berlin, Boston and Budapest.

But if you fancy exploring new sexual heights at one of Club Hermione’s hedonistic events, you’ll have to pass the the strict entry process first.

As well as being aimed exclusively at “highly-attractive professional couples and single girls” between the ages of 18 and 45, hopefuls have to submit colour photos (face and body shots) as well as an explanation of why they want to join, before being meticulously vetted by a selection committee.

And if you send in a photo that’s a little too flattering that you can’t live up to in real life, you won’t be getting in.

So follow these nifty tips and you’ll be an expert on going south in no time.

1. Start off slow

You have to start off in a teasing manner to get her warmed up.

Try kissing and nibbling her inner thighs, breathing on her labia or a gentle lick of the tongue. Slowly start to move down, gaining intensity and speed.

*** How to give her a multiple orgasm ***

2. Switch it up

Don’t focus all of your attention on her clitoris. It has 8,000 nerve endings and can actually get super sensitive.

So spread the love around by exploring other areas and vary your technique. Make your tongue pointy or flat, soft or rigid.

3. Get handsy

Once you’ve got into the swing of things, don’t forget to use your fingers but do remember to be gentle.

Start off with one finger inside her vagina and graduate to two. Continue to kiss and suck as you go.

4. Play with toys

Using a vibrator can add another dimension to her arousal. There’s no shame in using a toy to help out considering that the average woman takes around 20 minutes to climax from oral sex.

Use a small vibrator on the clitoral hood as you spend time with your tongue in the labia area.

1. Chest Is Best

A whopping 34% of women said that their nipples were the part of their body that gave them the most sexual pleasure.

3. Bottoms Up

The next top zone was a woman’s bum with 15% saying they found their behinds at the forefront of pleasure.

*** How important is sex to a woman? The answer will shock you ***

4. Back It Up

Another eye-opening result was that 6% of ladies liked their backs best. To spice things up, try caressing and stroking your partner’s spine and see how she responds.

5. Yummy Tummy

Coming in last but still making the top five was a woman’s stomach. Just 4% reckoned that it was the most attractive area.

And the men....

Lads pretty much agreed with women and listed very similar areas as the most arousing.

The top place was tied with a massive 19% of boys saying that their necks were the sexiest parts of their physiques while 19% said their butts got them going.

Coming up next in the stimulation stakes was their nipples (12%) closely followed by their stomachs (11%).

Interestingly 8% of guys found their legs the most exciting body part.

These stats were part of a poll that also found men's average penis size (hint: it’s bigger than you think) and what age people really lost their virginity.

It turns out that lads are more likely to swipe right on Tinder if girls have their ample assets on display.

A cheeky boob-based Catfish-style experiment into online dating revealed all about how men judge women on the app and what kind of attributes they are looking for in the opposite sex.

*** Uproar erupts as Tinder bans transgender people from dating app ***

And shockingly women's attractiveness went up by 9% for each cup size, according to researchers from MYA Cosmetic Surgery.

They created two identical profiles on Tinder for fictional 24-year-old Carla from Manchester. Everything about the two profiles was the same apart from the size of her knockers.

The pretty blonde’s profile picture was doctored so that in the first snap she had an A-cup bust and in the second her cup size was a DD.

By setting the preferences such as age and distance the same, the researchers swiped right to 1,000 men on each of the fake profiles.

Over the course of a week they waited with baited breath for the matches to come rolling in.

Tinder men cast their votes, and sure enough the less busty Carla received 602 matches while her big-bosomed twin got 809 matches.

This means that despite looking almost exactly the same in both pics 34% more Tinder daters wanted to take the curvier Carla out.

But let’s be honest – men like boobs whatever the shape and size they are.

In a similar test, a dating pro set up a fake Tinder profile to prove men really are as superficial as we feared when it comes to online dating.

Hayley Quinn set up two contrasting profiles on the dating app. One featured the real her and the other included a dumbed-down bio and superficial sexy photos of her in fake eyelashes and lashings of make-up.

But when you’ve exhausted the range of phallic fruits on your phone, would you send a condom emoji to make sure that your partner was planning on wrapping up before the act?

*** Your most embarrassing sexual health questions answered ***

First there was the shocking collection of penis, vagina and strap-on emojis and now the condom image could be on it's way.

Leading condom company Durex is calling for “the first official safe-sex emoji” to be created by Unicode, the company behind the tiny icons, on the back of World AIDS Day yesterday.

The sexual wellbeing brand crunched some numbers and found that 80% of 16-25 year olds find it easier to express themselves using emojis and 84% always use them when it comes to talking about sex because it makes them feel more comfortable.

More shockingly, stats revealed an alarming trend in youngsters’ attitudes towards using protection.

Over 56% confessed they weren’t worried about safe sex and a third said they didn’t care at all.

The sexperts designed a cartoony light blue condom which they think will be “vital” to bedroom banter.

“Durex believes in happier, healthier sex lives and World AIDS Day is a hugely significant reminder about the importance of safe sex,” said the brand’s global director Volker Sydow.

“Looking at how influential messaging is in the development of relationships today, an official safe sex emoji is a simple and empowering step towards better protection and sexual wellbeing.”

But could the condom emoji change sex chats by helping lovers overcome embarrassment and encouraging conversations about contraceptives?

Sex lecturer Dr. Mark McCormack reckons it will.

“Many young people have gained their sexual knowledge through their own sexual activity and searching the internet,” the Durham University expert said.

“While participants generally felt able to discuss safe sex within their romantic relationships, there was more uncertainty with new or potential partners. 80% welcomed the idea of the emoji to make the discussion of safe sex easier and more fun,” he explained.","vulgar"

HIV and AIDS are both acronymns.

HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This is because its a virus that can only affect human beings, and it creates a deficiency, or a failure to work properly, within the body's immune system.

AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. This is because its a condition that somebody must acquire or be infected with, and its labelled a syndrome because someone with AIDS may experience a wide range of different diseases.

*** Your most embarrassing sexual health questions answered ***

2. How is HIV passed on?

HIV is carried by bodily fluids such as semen, breast milk and blood but the virus is only transmitted when it enters another person’s bloodstream. HIV is not carried by saliva.

It is most commonly passed on through unprotected vaginal or anal sex, but also through sharing intravenous needles or from mother to baby during childbirth, or as a result of breastfeeding.

3. What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?

HIV causes an infection that can lead to AIDS. You can have HIV without having AIDS, and many people live for many years with HIV without ever developing AIDS. But if you have AIDS, you have to have HIV.

4. How many people does HIV affect?

HIV is a major global public health issue, and there’s currently about 36.9million people living with HIV. In the UK, it’s thought that up to 18,000 people are unaware that they have HIV.

5. Is there a cure for HIV or AIDS?

There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS, but advances in medicine over the last thirty years now mean that there are treatments on offer.

Treatments, such as Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), work by reducing the amount of the HIV virus in the body and strengthening the immune system.

Contracting HIV is not necessarily a death sentence, but it does require life-long medication.","vulgar"

More than three quarters of the residents would rate their neighbours as attractive - which probably means it's a hotspot for Tinder success.

The results come from YouGov CityBus after they polled those living in 12 big cities across the UK.

Cardiff comes a close second to the Brightonians with 72% of residents finding their fellow dwellers as attractive.

About half of the population in Cambridge and Norwich fancy the people around their town and only four out of 10 in Coventry and Southampton think they have cute townsfolk.

Almost two-thirds (63%) of Londoners would class others in the capital as attractive - which is a surprisingly high result considering no one ever makes eye contact.

Newcastle 63%

The stunning images have all been shot by amateurs and pros using the US tech giant's latest iPhone 6s.

Apple combed through tens of thousands of images submitted to them for their World Gallery event.

53 of the best snaps have now been chosen to feature in this year's gallery with it taking a human approach and focusing on people.

World Gallery was created as an expression of how iPhone has fundamentally transformed our relationship to photography, and to honour the mobile photography culture that iPhone has played an integral part in creating.

Apple say they hope the gallery inspire more people to experiment and take photos with their iPhones.

Apple launched their latest iPhone 6s and 6s Plus last September and included an improved camera.

With a 12-megapixel sensor, advanced pixel technology and new image signal processor, Apple say this camera produces truer colours and sharper, more detailed photos.

Apple's iPhone snapper can also shoot in full Ultra HD 4K quality and features optical image stabilisation which should stop the wobbles when shooting video.

The US firm also introduced Live Photos which makes images come to life with a simple press on the screen.

Use Burst Mode:

Burst mode on the iPhone continuously captures 10 photos per second, letting you take hundreds of images so you don't miss a single moment.

From the Camera app, just tap and hold the shutter until you think you’ve got your snap (or your memory runs out!)

Favourites are automatically selected but you can also choose your own.

Add effects:

Apple’s iPhone filters can add stunning effects to your snaps quickly and easily with just a swipe.

Pick one of eight Apple-designed filters and see it live before you take the shot.

But don’t panic, if you don’t like what you’ve taken you can always change it later.

Be flash:

True Tone flash on the iPhone captures vibrant colours in their purest form when shooting in low light.

The clever flash is able to determine just the right balance of ambient light versus flash for more natural-looking skin tones.

And the result is a beautiful shot with more true-to-life colours.

Go slow:

If you're videoing a moment packed with action, remember the iPhone’s slow motion mode.

Record the footage then pick which parts you want to see at full speed and which in super slow-motion.

More top tips:

• Set the Auto Focus and Auto Exposure by pressing and holding anywhere you want on the image

• If the picture is a little dark, tap on a shadow to brighten the exposure

• Want to take a picture while you are recording? Grab it by tapping the white circle to the left of your record button

Tests have revealed that when Facebook is installed on Android phones they can run up to 15% slower.

One Facebook fan has now taken to Reddit to reveal the findings which show a huge difference in performance when the social media app is ditched.

The test involved launching 15 popular apps in succession with each loading much faster when Facebook wasn't installed on the phone.

The Reddit user named pbrandes_eth was so shocked by the speed issues he's uninstalled Facebook saying: ""So yeah, I think that settles it for me... I am joining the browser-app camp for now.""

As well as the dip in speed it also appears Facebook is hurting Android smartphone batteries.

In another test performed by the Guardian, the Facebook app ate its way through an extra 20% of the phone's juice.

Their findings showed that while the Facebook app itself doesn't consume a huge amount of power, when uninstalled the Android operating system appears to be far less battery hungry.

Daily Star Online has been lucky enough to have an exclusive play on Sky Q and it’s left us hugely impressed.

The new set-top box is packed full of goodies and there’s plenty of extras including a new touchpad remote, updated app and totally refreshed look on the screen.

But, as we expected Sky Q isn’t cheap and with a starting price of £42 per month many will be asking if it’s worth the cash?

We certainly feel Sky Q has got plenty going for it but to get the best out of this new TV service you need to be prepared for some bill shock.

Sky Q has a basic box for £42 per month, this includes a 1TB hard drive and allows you to record three channels at once.

The other option is to splash the cash of Sky's premium Q Silver device which will set you back £54 per month.

The Q Silver features a 2TB hard drive, 12 tuners and it also includes the ability to show footage in Ultra HD 4K quality – future-proofing for Sky’s new UHD channels which arrive later this year.

With these added features we think the Silver is the must-have option.

Another bonus of taking this more expensive package is Sky will throw in a Q Mini device, which allows you to view Sky content in another room.

So here’s the catch.

If you want Sky Q Silver there’s the £54 per month charge – this includes over 300 channels and plenty of on demand content.

However, if you want to add Sky Sports and Movies you’ll need to fork out an extra £34.50 per month.

Then there’s the £50 installation charge and a on-off fee Sky is calling ""Smart Features"".

This ""Smart"" payment starts at £99 if you’ve taken out Sky Movies or Sports, but rises to £299 if you steer clear of these extra channels.

For the ultimate multi-room experience you’re likely to want to add another Q Mini box to your home which costs an extra £100.

Add all of this together over the 18-month contract and you’re left with a bill of over £1,800 – that’s more than £100 per month coming out of your bank account.

You can of course reduce this by ditching some services but you won’t then get a chance to savour all Sky Q has to offer.

Sky is also keen to point that some existing customers will actually SAVE money each month by switching to Sky Q.

Customers taking an older Sky+ package with two Multiscreen products, and Sky Movies would pay £75.50 per month – if they opted for the Sky Q Silver Bundle with Movies they would pay £71, a price cut of £4.50.

Sky Q is an awesome piece of tech and, although we’ve only spent a few hours playing with it, Sky customers are going to love this major upgrade.

They’ll just have to decide if all the brilliant new features are worth the extra cash.","geeky"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/491090/Airline-Total-Turbulence-technology-bringing-end-bumps","The end of airline turbulence? Why bump free flights could be here sooner than you think","It doesn't matter how often you board a plane the thought of ploughing through turbulence at 35,000 feet is still terrifying.

Planes hit bumpy air every day of the week with most cases causing nothing more than the odd spill of tea from the seat tray table.

However, things can get pretty hairy at high altitudes and, although it's unlikely to every bring a plane crashing to the ground, severe turbulence can injure passengers and crew who might not be strapped to their seats.

Now the latest tech is aiming to bring an end to terror of turbulence and it's already flying high in our skies.

Total Turbulence is a new system from The Weather Company and it's set revolutionise air travel.

Fitted to the latest aircraft the system keeps a constant watch on what's going on miles above our heads.

State-of-the-art software monitors every bump and even measures the exact force of the turbulent air outside the plane.

All of this data is then instantly relaying to the ground where it's mapped along with the latest weather reports from aviation meteorologists.

This vital information provides a detailed map of the world's turbulence which can then be beamed to pilots in the area helping them to pick clean air.

The end result is smoother, safer flights for everyone onboard and less costs to airlines – which often have to pick up the bill for damage and delays.

There are currently over 700 planes fitted with the Total Turbulence system with around 14,000 observations beamed back to the ground every day.

Speaking about the system Mark D. Miller, Vice President and General Manager, Decision Support told Daily Star Online: ""Turbulence free flights are definitely the goal and we're making significant progress towards that goal.

""Science and technology allows continuous improvement in our ability to forecast areas where we can expect turbulence.

""Over the next five to ten years, computer power will increase and the flight models will get more sophisticated so you could envision significant improvement in our ability to predict where turbulence is.

""This is an area that's improving all the time and the aim is to predict 100% of turbulent areas and the industry is working hard towards that goal"".

The system is currently installed on mainly US airlines with UK carriers thought to be interested in the concept.

Total Turbulence says it's already reducing the effects of turbulence by around 50% and, with more aircraft being fitted with the system, this success rate is set to rapidly increase.

The new system is all ready covering most of the Atlantic, North America and large parts of Asia with Europe’s turbulence mapping also getting better.

And with modern planes becoming better connected with fast WiFi this turbulence mapping can even be beamed directly to pilot's tablets in the cockpit.

New planes such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner are also able to fly higher allowing them to glide over most bumpy conditions.

So, with all this new turbulence technology the dream of a turbulent free flights might soon be a reality.","geeky"

Kayla Morris, 21, revealed she’d been planning to get a boob job since she was just 11-years-old.

And as soon as she legally could, she forked over £5,000 to go from a 32C to a 32G, but mum Georgina was 100% behind her daughter.

The 39-year-old told Channel 5's Celebrity Botched Up Bodies: “I remember her really wanting one [the procedure] from 11 upwards; she planned it and how she was going to get the money for it.”

*** Woman has own fat pumped into butt to get Kim Kardashian's killer curves ***

To raise the cash Kayla began stripping at a Birmingham lap dancing club – raking in up to £1,300 a week.

She also picked up a sugar daddy in his fifties at the age of 18, who gave her £800 every week in exchange for “companionship”.

Kayla said: “One night when I was working at the strip club, I started talking to a married guy in his late fifties who wanted to be my sugar daddy and pay for my upkeep.

“We swapped numbers and chatted for a while.

""I told him about the surgery that I wanted and we came to an arrangement where he paid me £800 per week.

“I was thrilled although I was scared to tell my mum about my sugar daddy.

""But when I told her about him and explained how the money would go towards our cosmetic work, she was pleased for me.”

Georgina added: “When Kayla told me that she wanted a boob job and plastic surgery, I was glad because I wanted her to be that kind of person.

“I don't mind her having a sugar daddy or stripping to pay for our cosmetic work because we're living the dream. I knew it made Kayla happy and she insisted we use it to get plastic surgery together.”

So now Kayla funds her mum’s enhancements too. In the past three years, the surgery-obsessed pair have had 15 rounds of lip injections to plum up their plastic pouts, three sets of cheek fillers and over 18 Botox sessions.

On top of that, they regularly dye their platinum locks, whiten their teeth and plaster themselves with semi-permanent make-up to look more like Katie.

Both are currently single and planning more surgery later this year, but Kayla’s also on the hunt for a new older lover after her last sugar daddy broke things off when his wife found out.

The women will both have another boob job, along with butt implants, a nose job, more lip fillers, veneers and a designer vagina for Georgina.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/491944/Woman-anorgasmia-sex-cant-orgasm-sex-toys-vibrators-vagina","Woman who masturbates every day with 10 sex toys can't orgasm: 'My vagina won't do it'","Megan Ward has spent more than three years trying and failing to achieve an orgasm.

Despite pleasuring herself every day with a drawer full of vibrators, the 20-year-old is constantly left unsatisfied.

She was eventually diagnosed with anorgasmia – a sex disorder meaning she can’t climax – which shockingly affects as many as one in 15 women.

Writing for student newspaper The Tab, Megan revealed that she’s been desperately trying out every possible way to climax but it still remains out of reach.

*** Can you guess the most dangerous sexual act? It can kill you in 30 minutes ***

She said: ""I now own 10 different kinds of vibrators, among many other sex toys which would make your grandma's eyes bleed.

""While I love them all in the same way most people love their pets – and admittedly the Magic Wand has changed my life – they still don't produce the big O from me.

""My vagina, she tries, bless her, but it's just not something she can do.""

Megan, who’s studying at Birmingham University, was worried about how people would react when she spoke out about her frustrating problem – thinking she’d be branded “weird” or “pathetic”.

But the youngster was glad that she opened up when she was inundated with messages from supporters.

Megan explained: ""I got messages from people I had spoken to maybe once all congratulating me. Some of my best friends shared the piece and wrote publicly they were proud of me.

""Strangers stalked me down on Facebook – some in a creepy way – but others to say thank you for writing the piece.""

The pretty brunette was also relieved that her friends were 100% behind her decision to speak out.

*** Can you guess how big the average vagina really is? ***

She said: ""I got to pre-drinks the night it was published, only for two of my best friends to make orgasm jokes the minute I walked in the room.

""But as with all good friendships, it became something they would wind me up about, but overall, it didn't change a thing.""

And despite talking all about her masturbation habits in a national newspaper article, Megan’s parents were incredibly proud of her.

Although Megan did admit that some people used her article about anorgasmia to make cheap shots at her – like a girl she knew who lashed out when they were debating the general election.

The girl wrote on Facebook: ""If politics was so important to you, you'd write less articles about your vagina and more about what really matters.""

Given that Megan had also written articles about LGBT rights, mental health, the monarchy and feminism she didn't think the comment was fair – but it still made her feel awful.

She said: ""I wrote about my vagina and so apparently that meant any opinion I had on anything else didn't matter.

""I was so proud of my article, but I didn't want to be the Orgasm Girl.

""And yet, now that is all some people see me as.""

Of course, the student had quite a few creepy messages land in her inbox.

She said: ""I don't know why men felt the need to track me down and proposition me, but apparently they did.

""One gem was the guy who tracked me down to say I just hadn't met the right man yet, but since I'm not too bad looking I'll be OK.

""He missed the whole point of the article – as well as insulting my boyfriend and knocking my self-esteem in the process.""

Explaining the reason she did share her frustrating problem, Megan said: ""It really wasn’t written for attention.

""I wrote it because the prioritisation of male orgasm over female is wrong. The average age a boy comes for the first time is 12 and for girls it’s 18.

""The article was about changing those facts. It was about getting women to demand more sexual pleasure for themselves. I am still amazed at the amount of women who fake orgasms.

""I didn’t want anyone else feeling ashamed or embarrassed or alone like I felt.

""If it did change how someone felt, even if it’s just a few people, then I don’t mind being Orgasm Girl and I will gladly write about my vagina again to stop people feeling that way.""","boorish"

Now Ashton lives as a man – and he loves working on his muscles and spending time with his straight girlfriend.

He said: ""When I came out as transgender, people didn't understand that I wanted to be a man when I was such a pretty girl. But being this beautiful blonde girl wasn't really who I was inside.

""I'm much happier as a man and I don't miss the dresses and make-up – I love having stubble and biceps. This is my true self.""

Ashton first felt unhappy about his gender when he was as a toddler but found it difficult to come out as transgender.

He explained: ""My mum wanted me to do ballet and wear dresses, but I was a tomboy and into baseball.

""Deep down inside from an early age, I knew that I would be happier if I was a man. But everyone kept telling what a pretty girl I was, so I ignored my feeling and tried to fit in.""

Ashton came out as a lesbian at the age of 13, but still felt the pressure to be ""feminine"".

*** Transgender woman splashes £52k on plastic surgery: 'It’s not a drug but I need it' ***

He added: ""I was attracted to girls but I still didn't feel I was being myself.

""I tried to be a girly lesbian and put a lot of effort into trying to convince people that I was happy.

""My friends and family encouraged me to be girlie so I went to the gym a lot and I did my hair and make-up every day. Lots of the girls at school were jealous of my looks.""

Ashton's beauty caught the attention of local pageant coaches and at the age of 17 he started competing in beauty contests.

Over the next two years Ashton took part in over six pageants – bagging multiple trophies as well as being crowned runner-up in Miss Teen Columbus.

Ashton remembered: ""I excelled in those beauty contests and my family were so proud of me when I did them. I knew I could make a good career from doing pageants but showing off my body in figure-hugging dresses didn't feel right.

""I thought if I kept showing people that I was the prettiest girl out there at these competitions then I wouldn't have these feelings of being a man inside.

""I didn't know anything about being transgender either so it was very confusing.""

But by November 2011 Ashton started finding it difficult to suppress his desires and took part in his final pageant, Miss Ohio.

""My last pageant was Miss Ohio, which could have led to Miss America,” he said. “But when I was competing for Miss Ohio, I felt so uncomfortable and anxious on stage. I hated it. I couldn't keep up the act, messed up and broke down in tears after the show.”

Ashton began watching YouTube videos about trans men who were the same age, and they gave him the confidence to realise who he was and accept himself.

In February 2012 he came out as transgender and began living as a man but his confession shocked friends and family who didn’t understand why he would want to give up life as a “gorgeous woman”.

Ashton, who studies Public Affairs at university, continued: ""I had grown up getting a lot of validation for my pretty looks so when I came out as transgender, lots of people were shocked and confused.

""It had only been about six months since my last pageant and people couldn't understand why I would want to throw my beauty queen future and beautiful looks away.

""Everyone said I would regret my decision.”

At the beginning, Ashton’s mother found his decision difficult to deal with.

He said: ""My mum was devastated that I was throwing away all the effort and success that I had in pageants.

""She thought I could have an easy life staying as this pretty girl and was worried I would be ugly after transitioning.

""For a few months, my mum didn't speak to me.

""But my father was very accepting and eventually my mum came around too.

""My friends supported me as well, lots of my girl friends were pleased that they got to have my old pageant clothes.""

A year after he began taking testosterone, Ashton’s father paid for him to have a double mastectomy costing £5,600.

The youngster was thrilled to see the changes in his body and felt much more comfortable in his skin,

He said: ""It was amazing being seen as a boy by everyone finally.

""After a few years on testosterone and my chest surgery, I started developing into the man I wanted to be. My voice got deeper and my chest was hairier.

""I love going to the gym now and lifting weights. I want to have masculine muscles and be really strong physically.""

*** Transgender woman goes out on the pull with WIFE ***

Ashton’s found love with his girlfriend of one year, Laura, but he’s not sure if he wants to undergo sexual re-assignment surgery.

""I have a girlfriend who loves me for who I am and I am happier than ever,"" Ashton said. ""I’m still figuring out whether I want the gender-reassignment surgery and one day we hope to adopt kids.""

In a bid to help other teens struggling with their gender, he runs a YouTube channel to raise awareness for trans issues.

He said: ""YouTube really helped me through my transition and I wanted to give something back. I've had a beautiful outpouring of support from my viewers.

""I'm confident enough now to explore who I really am. I don't care what other people think anymore.""","boorish"

Heading to nightclubs together to flirt with men has become the norm for Claire and Marcus Atkins.

Claire, 41, was married to Marcus, 37, for six years before he announced that he wanted to live as a woman.

The former butch builder sold his motorbike to pay for 36E breasts, started taking hormones and changed her name to Celeste back in 2013.

*** Transgender man reveals sex-life secrets: 'My romps are better than most straight couples' ***

But Claire and Celeste, who have three kids, are still married and live together as they go out to look for new boyfriends.

Claire, a student nurse, said: ""We've both said that we probably get on better now than we did while we were married.

""We go out most weekends so it's quite normal now and have a lot of fun together playing wing-woman for each other.

""We're both very supportive and want each other to be happy and find someone who is suitable for each other.""

The pair met in 2005 and were married within a year following a whirlwind romance.

But seven years later, Claire thought that her husband was cheating when their sex life dried up and he began hitting the bottle.

Finally a drunken Marcus broke down on their staircase and confessed that he always known he was a woman in a man's body and wanted to start living as Celeste.

*** Transgender woman splashes £52k on plastic surgery: 'It's not a drug but I need it' ***

Celeste said: ""It was really difficult knowing how to tell our children that I needed to look different and be a girl, but they have been really accepting.

""I think our youngest daughter will never remember me as a man, she was three when I started dressing as a woman.

""They have all been totally supportive, proud and stayed alongside me even when I didn't look myself early into the transition. My kids have been great and done little things like holding my hand to show me support.

""They stopped calling me 'dad' as soon as I told them. They just call me Celeste now.""

Celeste explained: ""I had been trying to convince myself I was a guy my whole life when I wasn't, I'd turned to masculine interests like motorbikes when deep down I wanted to ride ponies.

""I was terrified of what my family would say, telling Claire was one of the most difficult things I've ever done but I couldn't carry on.

""Our sex life was non-existent, it had stopped years before because I wasn't attracted to Claire and she was fed up of me going to the pub and getting drunk.

""One night after a drink for courage I cried and blurted out what I wanted to say for my whole life – that I was born in the wrong body and was a woman.""

She changed her name and began taking feminine hormones she bought off the internet before having full gender reassignment surgery to complete her transformation last December.

Claire decided to stick by her transgender partner while she underwent surgery and started to physically become a woman.

She said: ""Marcus and Celeste are polar opposites, he wasn't a people person at all but Celeste she's really sociable, outgoing and friendly with everyone she meets.

""You couldn't have found a more manly man before with the way he acted and looked, you would wouldn't ever have thought for one minute he'd become Celeste, it wouldn't seem possible.

""Most people think it's really weird and say they would have been out the door and gone but for me I couldn't leave her – we're not a conventional family but who is nowadays.""

Speaking about how she copes seeing her husband out on the pull, Claire added: ""Seeing Celeste with other people doesn't bother me in the slightest, the only time I'll object is if I think she's got her vodka goggles on.

""She normally doesn't agree with my choice of men but she likes pretty boys and I prefer them all grungy and wearing greasy overalls so it's different.

""We've never had to fight over the same man yet as we like really different times she prefers the more glamorous guys.

""She's quite protective over me and my choice in men, if anyone upsets me they have her to deal with.

""At the end of the day anyone I want to have a relationship with has to accept Celeste and her past too.”

The couple’s children have also been supportive of their unusual family situation.

Celeste added: ""I still love Claire to pieces, she's been my rock and pushed me so hard to face the challenges of transgender surgery I can't thank her enough.

""Now when I see pictures of myself before I became a woman I can barely recognise the person staring back at me, I'm finally able to be the lady I knew I am inside.

""Both of us are now moving on with our lives and there's nothing more I want then for Claire to be happy and find a man.

""Our taste in men is totally opposite, so we've don't have to worry about pinching each other's boyfriends.""","boorish"

Here is a round-up of nine of the best optical illusions that will have you staring at the screen for hours.

*** What's that between her legs? 11 photos that aren’t as rude as they look ***

It’s safe to say you’re thinking you can see a penis hanging out the bottom of this woman’s skirt but that’s really not the case.

What’s really going on here is she’s sat on a nude-coloured bike seat – not rude at all.

Did a woman turn up to this party in her birthday suit? It seems bizarre that no-one seemed bothered that the brunette was in the buff as they smiled for the camera.

It’s because her starkers body is really just her friend’s arm, and she’s resting her hand on her mate’s shoulder.

At first glance this looks like it could be an explicit sexual act.

But once your eyes have gotten over the shock you realise that it’s actually quite touching.

What the pic really shows is a child’s hand gripped around an adult’s thumb.

A close-up look at this snap seems as though it would belong on an adult website.

Although this woman’s bikini hasn’t gone missing and those aren’t her bare boobs.

The only nudity you can see is her naked kneecaps.

These two girls seem as though they’re very close indeed – and the blonde appears to have gone out without a skirt on.

Before you call the police for indecent exposure, look again and see that the brunette is sitting on a chair next to her friend.

Her legs are crossed in front and her hand is wedged between her own knees.

You could easily be copping an eyeful of a busty woman’s ample assets.

Well, try not to be too disappointed when you find out it’s really just an open book.

This artsy greyscale shot looks like a portrait of a woman’s most intimate area.

When you tilt your head to the left you’ll realise that it’s a zoomed in pic of someone sleeping with very long eyelashes.

This cover of a religious book has got people a bit confused.

It shows a man on his knees with one arm in the air apparently in intense prayer, but the position of his bent arm makes it seem like he’s pleasuring himself.

The photographer behind this black-and-white portrait wasn’t thinking it’d come out like this.

Because of the angle you’d easily think that this was a glamour shot although you’d be mistaken.

The gorgeous girl is kneeling down and not putting her breasts on show.

Is that a woman wearing a very low cut black top?

No, not at all. On closer inspection it’s actually a folded piece of paper on a hook.","boorish"

And a capsule containing a class-B drug is the latest product to hit the market. This week the world’s first weed-infused vagina pill was released by Foria.

*** Women are sticking vodka-soaked tampons up their vaginas – and the effects are shocking ***

Dubbed Foria Relief, the vaginal suppository is basically medical marijuana for your lady bits and it’s designed to ease period pains and menstrual cramps.

Made from cocoa butter infused with a mix of THC (cannabis’s hallucinogenic element) and CBD (the healing part), the tampon-sized insert aims to “maximise muscle relaxing and pain relieving” without getting you high.

Considering that more than 84% of women experience cramps during their period, according to a study in the Journal of Pain Research, a new treatment could change many lives.

Foria founder Mathew Gerson said: “This plant medicine has a long, cross-cultural history of use as a natural aide in easing symptoms associated with menstruation.

“Our intention is to share the powerful medicinal properties of this plant while utilising modern extraction techniques.

“The pelvic region contains more cannabinoid receptors than any other part of the body except for the brain.

“So delivering these actives in a suppository format is a natural choice.”

Because the pill is inserted into the vagina, it’s going straight to the painful spot and apparently the side effects will be minimal.

Currently the pills are only available from medical dispensaries in California, but they’ll soon be available in Colorado too.

They can be bought online – £30 for four capsules – providing you have a medical marijuana card and live in one of the 23 US states that has legalised the sale of weed for health purposes.

But at the moment in the UK the government haven’t recognised the medicinal value of weed – even heroin is ranked as having more therapeutic benefits – so it’s unlikely that Brits will be popping pot pills into their vaginas anytime soon.

Apparently though the idea of using canabis for menstrual pain isn’t new. In fact Queen Victoria was prescribed the drug to ease her cramps – but she didn't put it up her vagina.","boorish"

And now another man has found his long lost twin stranger. Tom Moffatt shared a photo of his mate Rob Winston stood next to a man who could have been his mirror image.

He posted the double-take snap on Imgur with the caption: “My friend Rob (on the left), who is a stand-up comedian, met his doppelgänger last night. He was performing at a gig in London.

“I couldn't believe it when I saw the likeness. Same amount of stubble. Same hair style. Same glasses. They are, as far as we know, unrelated.”

Rob’s brother from another mother is Kobi and, weirder still, they both tell jokes for a living.

Speaking about the uncanny event, Rob said: “An audience member approached me and mentioned that she went up to a guy that looked exactly like me.

“She was complimenting him on my material. When I saw him I was like damn.

""This is crazy. We look so similar. What are the odds?”

He told Metro: “He just moved here from Israeli and is prepping for his first English-language gig.”

The pair had a little chat and snapped a pic before Kobi had to dash off to catch his train.

“We got that selfie though,” Rob added. “I would have chased him down the street if he had left without one.”

And it seems like this could be the start of a beautiful friendship. The twin strangers have already cemented their bond by adding each other on Facebook and swapping invites for their next stand-up gigs.

Meanwhile, the young women who found out that they were lookalikes online recently took a DNA test to see if they were in fact related.

Niamh Geaney tracked down her doppelgänger Irene Adams and discovered she lived just an hour away.

But surprisingly the results showed that they had just a 1.1% chance of being half sisters despite both being Irish and the spitting image of one another.

Niamh, 27, said: ""We both always had this natural curiosity to find out if we were related at all.

""It was the comments on YouTube and social media that finally made us go for the test, everyone was just so curious and wanted us to prove we weren't related.

""I mean we just wanted to know if there was something more behind us being identical, I thought at least 200,000 years ago there might have been a connection.

""When we got the results we weren't too surprised, we didn't expect anything to come of it really, it would have been really special if we had but the whole point of a doppelgänger is that you're not supposed to be related.""","boorish"

Annabelle Burnham, a consultant gynaecologist for Medstars.co.uk, explains everything you need to know about preventing the disease and spotting the symptoms.

*** Your most embarrassing sexual health questions answered ***

What are the symptoms of cervical cancer?

Cervical cancer very often doesn’t have any symptoms until it is quite advanced, but the main one is usually abnormal bleeding (especially in post-menopausal women).

Watch out for bleeding that occurs between regular periods, bleeding after sex, longer and heavier periods and bleeding after going through the menopause.

Women may also notice a change in discharge – where is becomes more watery and smelly – pelvic pain and pain during sex.

Studies have found that infection with the virus called human papilloma virus (HPV) is the cause of almost all cervical cancers.

But importantly not all women experience symptoms at all which is why smear tests are so important.

What are the symptoms of HPV?

HPV, a common sexually transmitted infection, can be a precursor to cervical cancer.

It’s important to know the symptoms including small growths around the genitals which can clump together to form cauliflower like clusters.

Before they become sexually active, young girls aged 13 are offered a vaccination to protect against the HPV virus to prevent cervical cancer.

*** Is YOUR vagina normal? ***

What puts you more at risk of getting cervical cancer?

An HPV infection that doesn’t go away can cause cervical cancer in some women. Also smoking promotes the abnormalities caused by the HPV virus.

Women who smoke are more likely to have cancerous abnormalities in the cervix. Quitting smoking is a key way to reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer.

How do you get tested?

This week stats from Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust showed that almost 3.7million women in the UK are putting themselves at risk of cervical cancer by not attending regular smear tests.

A smear test is still the most effective way of identifying cervical cancer, or the signs of changes to the cervix before they become a problem.

When should you have them done?

Women should start going for a smear test from the age of 25 and should go every three years until they are 50, in order to monitor for abnormalities.

After this point, women should go every five years and carry on until they are 65 years old. Abnormalities are very easy to test for, because the cervix – unlike any other part of the womb – is much more accessible for sampling.

Statistically, some of the worst people to miss a smear test are smokers, as they are at higher risk of getting the disease.

Once you have received treatment for an abnormal smear test result – which may be to have more frequent tests or less – you should stick to the instructions that you have been given.

Does having a smear test hurt? How do they do it?

No, it doesn’t hurt and it’s a lot easier if you relax. It only takes about five minutes. You lay on a bed, undressed from the waist down, put your feet together and relax your knees out to the side.

The doctor or nurse then inserts a speculum into your vagina, which holds the vaginal walls apart and they then take a sample with a swab or brush, from your cervix.","boorish"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/490564/Vodka-tampon-vagina-health-risk-side-effect-drunk","Women are sticking vodka-soaked tampons up their vaginas – and the effects are shocking","A vodka-soaked tampon or “vodpon” is exactly what it sounds like.

Shockingly teenagers and young women are soaking tampons in alcohol and putting them inside their vaginas in a bid to get drunk faster.

A quick search on YouTube will show you how common it is. It draws in over 6,000 results, with many people continuing to attempt the unsafe practice.

*** Bizarre VAGINA STICK claims to make women feel 'tight and wanted again' ***

And while it’s not necessarily a new trend, it’s ongoing popularity is worrying. Alcohol-infused sanitary products first emerged in Helsinki back in 1999 with teen Finnish girls hoping to get tipsy without their parents smelling the booze on their breath.

But what are the real dangers involved in this risky behaviour? In short, you could do some serious damage to your downstairs.

There are even websites where people blog about their first-hand experiences or offer “how to” tutorials to encourage it.

*** Is YOUR vagina normal? Embarrassing questions answered ***

Dr Toli Onon, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) told Dailystar.co.uk: “The RCOG would strongly advise against using tampons soaked in any kind of alcohol.

“Alcohol is an antiseptic and disturbing the balance of ‘good’ bacteria inside the vagina in this way can increase the risk of infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or thrush.

“Alcohol can also be very irritant to the vaginal skin, and may cause stinging pain and inflammation.

“Anyone who is worried about vaginal irritation or itching, should seek advice from their GP or pharmacist as they may have an infection that needs treatment.”

Meanwhile London Gynaecology consultant Mr N. Pisal agreed that the mad craze is best avoided – and it probably wouldn’t work anyway.

“Vaginal mucosa [the lining of the vagina] is very similar to the mouth and if you hold a mouthful of vodka for an hour, there will be still plenty left to spit out,"" he explained.

“In other words, some alcohol will be absorbed but not enough to get one drunk.”

Believe it or not, some scientists even decided to test out tampons to see how much alcohol they’d absorb on the back of this worrying trend.

*** Women are sticking herb balls up their vaginas for the most bizarre reason ***

The recent study found that a tampon in its applicator would only soak up 15ml of vodka when the standard size of a shot is around 40ml.

If you remove the casing, then a tampon can suck up about 30ml of booze but it would make it pretty difficult to insert.

But this isn’t the only trend to see youngsters putting liquor in places it really shouldn’t go.

An alcohol enema, or “butt-chugging”, has long since been a dangerous drinking habit practiced by US college students – which saw frat boys sent to hospital with severe alcohol poisoning.

More recently, there’s been a concerning vogue for “detoxing” your vagina.

More and more products are flooding the market promising to make you “feel tight and wanted again” like the Japanese vagina stick.

The phallic object contains ancient herbs such as high-quality Manjakani and pearl powder which has been used by women in Asia, Arabia and Persia for generations.

According to vaginal-tightening.com, which claims to be the number one best seller of these kinds of wands and sticks, there’s a range of benefits.

Not only can the bizarre device allegedly prevent infections, eliminate vaginal discharge and moisten your lady parts, but it can improve your sex life too.

Similarly, tea-bag like balls dubbed “vaginal pearls” claim to cleanse the uterus thanks to a blend of ancient herbs.

According to Embrace Pangaea – an online shop that sells them – women are advised to keep them there for three whole days.

The holistic seller promises that the “herbal womb detox pearls” can fix common problems like bacteria vaginosis (BV), yeast infections, endometriosis, foul odour and fibroids – although there’s no scientific proof to back it up.

Although what’s most alarming is that experts think that the weird craze could actually damage women’s health.

Dr Vanessa Mackay, of RCOG, told Dailystar.co.uk: “The vagina is designed to clean itself with natural secretions and should not require a ‘detox’.

“Perfumed products, soaps, gels, antiseptics, and vaginal douches can all affect the pH levels and the healthy balance of bacteria in the vagina, and cause irritation.”

Also, leaving a foreign object inside your vagina for longer than a day could cause toxic shock syndrome (TSS) – which is one of the reasons why you shouldn’t leave a tampon in for more than eight hours.

But there’s also the cast and crew working just as hard behind the scenes, so here’s a breakdown of what everyone in the porn industry is earning.

*** Sex worker answers intimate questions about life in a legal brothel ***

Unlike in Hollywood, women actualy make more money in the porn industry than men.

While superstar performers who’ve become household names rake in millions a year, newbies can be looking at only a couple of hundred pounds per scene.

The key factors are the level of on-camera experience a girl has and the type of sex act involved.

""When the girls first get into the business and they're new, I think they can command additional money for different sex acts,"" said Steven Hirsch, owner of adult studio Vivid.

""Initially they make more money, then it depends on how popular they become.""

If the actress is doing a “traditional” scene with a male star then she’s likely to pocket between £560 and £700 – depending on the production budget.

But top performers can earn as much as £1,050 or £1,400 for their efforts. On the flip side, newcomers with no reputation can be paid as little as £210.

Of course the more extreme the scene then the more money there is to be made from it. An adult actress could take home between £1,260 to £1,750 for their dirty work.

Generally lads get paid a fixed amount for the scene or for the day, meaning that there’s no pay difference depending on the sex act.

Some award-winning actors like Manuel Ferrara get top dollar, but most will be making much less.

Males are likely to trouser between £350 and £420 per scene or day depending on their agreement with the studio.

Better known stars can earn £490 to £630 while superstars would see a cheque of up to £1,050.

There’s much more that goes into a making a porno than just the performers having sex on camera. Most shoots last two to eight days and there’s a host of roles that you might not have thought about.

Directors are a lot more hands-on in this industry – sometimes juggling tasks such as location scouting, lighting and shooting as well – and that’s reflected in their pay.

A director of a feature-length film, not a short, is likely to earn around £700 or £1,050 each day with a few pros making upwards of £2,000.

Meanwhile a writer takes home much less, between £175 and £280 for a day’s work, and a cameraperson typically rakes in £500.

Make-up artists and still photographers – who snap shots for marketing purposes – are often paid £350 apiece.","boorish"

They hope such schemes will encourage moderate Muslims to reject terrorist ideology.

Dr House also told MPs that Google removed 14 million videos from YouTube in 2014 – many of them because of terrorist content.

Twitter’s public policy boss Nick Pickles also gave evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee.

US officials say the satellite could carry deadly long-range missiles into space.

It would give the tubby tyrant more chance of launching a rocket at any moment.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reportedly claimed he is prepared to work with America against the dumpy dictator.

Mr Abe said he would work with other countries to “strongly demand” North Korea stops its missile launch.

North Korea is under sanctions for its nuclear and missile programmes.

The US and South Korea are seeking fresh sanctions after its latest nuclear test.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said the UN needed to ""send the North Koreans a swift, firm message"".

But the secretive state has said it has a right to continue its space programme by launching rockets, despite the staunch opposition.

South Korea told its bitter rivals they will pay a “severe price” if it continues its long-range missile testing.

North Korea informed the International Maritime Organisation of its plans on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman from the IMO said: ""We have received information from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the launch of an earth observation satellite 'Kwangmyongsong' between 8-25 February.”

The satellite would be able to carry a long-range rocket, according to officials.

The crack unit has stepped up its undercover operations since brutal ISIS militants slaughtered 130 innocent people in Paris last November.

Around half of the 60 soldiers – who have decades of counter-terrorism experience between them – have formally re-enlisted.

Dozens more are on standby ahead of large scale deployments to Libya, Syria and Iraq.

In addition to their role behind enemy lines overseas, SAS troops have been staging plain-clothes patrols of UK city centres.

Defence sources said a similar number of veterans rejoined after the September 11 attacks and before the Iraq War.

A source said: “Former members of the SAS do rejoin the regiment, especially when there is a war approaching.”

The source said added that the threat from ISIS, also known as Daesh, encouraged many to return from the private security sector.

They added: “Our guys have a unique skill set so they are very difficult to recruit.

“When a soldier leaves you not only lose a member of the SAS but you also lose maybe 10 years of special operations and that can not be easily replaced.”

The cash allowed illegal immigrant Bourgass, 42, to argue at the Supreme Court he had been “unlawfully” segregated in jail. Prison chiefs isolated the al-Qaida fanatic for bullying fellow inmates in a bid to radicalise them.

Even though he had access to a TV, radio and books in solitary, judges ruled holding him alone for periods of up to seven months at a time in Whitemoor jail, Cambs, breached prison rules.

Retired Metropolitan Police chief Sidney Mackay, whose daughter WPc Nina Mackay, 25, was stabbed to death on duty in London in 1997, slammed Bourgass’s legal aid award.

He said: “It is outrageous that so much money is given to people who are enemies of the country.

“If terrorists are trying to indoctrinate other inmates it is only right they are segregated.”

Mr Mackay, who is chairman of the Police Roll of Honour Trust, added: “If their lawyers have such high ideals why don’t they do the work pro bono?”

Bleeding to death from eight stab wounds, Mr Oake, 40, who was not wearing body armour, clung on to his attacker to protect his police colleagues until Bourgass was overpowered.

His widow Lesley and three children were each given £13,000 in compensation. Algerian-born Bourgass was jailed for life for murder and another 17 years for plotting to spread ricin on the streets of Britain.

He was given a concurrent 15- year sentences for trying to kill the officers he wounded in the Manchester incident. Bourgass and al-Qaida liquid bomb plotter Tanvir Hussain, 34, each launched legal challenges to their jail segregation.

Five Supreme Court judges unanimously ruled their segregation for longer than 72 hours breached prison rules.

No claims for compensation have yet been submitted to the Ministry of Justice.

BRITISH soldiers could be forced to free prisoners of war after only 96 hours to avoid breaching their human rights.

The revelation came during a landmark legal case in the Supreme Court in which a convicted senior Taliban chief captured by Brit soldiers is suing the Ministry of Defence.

Both individuals have a history of travel to a Zika affected country, Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) confirmed.

The people involved are a man and an older woman.

Both had travelled to a country affected by the virus, which can cause birth defects, and both have fully recovered from the infection.

""These are the first cases of Zika virus infection confirmed in Ireland,"" a HSE spokeswoman said.

""Neither case is at risk of pregnancy.""

Health chiefs have urged Irish people who fall ill within two weeks after returning from an affected area to seek medical help.

The annoucement came as the first case was confirmed in the US which was transmitted through sex.

Dallas County Health and Human Services said the case in was acquired through sex, adding that it received confirmation of the infection from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

It comes as the WHO warned last week the virus, spread through mosquitoes, was ""spreading explosively"" and should be considered a ""public health emegency of international concern"".

The United Nations (UN) health agency estimates that as many as four million people could be infected with the virus this year.

There are no reports of the virus being locally transmitted by mosquitoes in the Texas county.

And the fact that the virus can be spread through sex raises the nightmare of the disease being passed among humans that do not get bitten by the bugs.

Officals did not identify the person infected. The CDC said it did not investigate how the virus was transmitted.

There have been six confirmed travel-related cases of Zika virus disease, all among residents of Harris County, where Houston is located, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.

In medical literature, there has been only one case of Zika transmitted sexually and one case in which the virus was detected in semen.

The person infected did not travel and acquired the virus from someone who had been to Venezuela, the county health department said on its twitter feed.

It did not provide further information on the Texas infection due to privacy concerns.

Australian officials also confirmed today that a citizen had been affected after being bitten by a monkey in Bali.

The WHO is under pressure to react quickly to the Zika virus, after being criticised for its slow response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa last year.

Following a meeting of an International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, WHO Director General Dr Margaret Chan said: “Members of the committee agree that the situation meets the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern.”

A man in Denmark has tested positive for the mosquito-transmitted virus after travelling to South and Central America, health officials claim.

Last week, it was revealed that three Brits had contracted the disease linked to babies born with shrunken heads.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/492003/What-happens-penis-body-take-Viagra-erection-how-long-last","This is what happens to your penis after you take Viagra","Since it became available back in 1998, Viagra has helped to save the sex lives of millions of men suffering from erectile dysfunction.

And while we all know guys take Viagra to get an erection, you might not know what the drug really does to your tackle or how long the effects can last.

A recent study by Superdrug looked into the effects of sildenafil – which is the medical term for the erectile dysfunction drug – to see how men reacted in the first 24 hours after taking it.

*** Best foods to boost your erection ***

Here’s what happens:

First 12 minutes

Viagra is quickly absorbed by the body and some men with erectile dysfunction can get an erection just 12 minutes after gobbling the meds.

27 minutes

If it hasn’t happened for you in the first 12, then you’re probably going to get hard within the first half an hour.

Researchers found that the average response time to Viagra was just 27 minutes – even though doctors say you should wait an hour before seeing results downstairs.

57 minutes

After nearly an hour has passed, you’ll reach your “maximum erection potential” because the drug reaches its highest concentration in the blood. This is why experts say you should pop it one hour before sex.

According to the study, men can have erections that last up to 33 minutes within an hour of taking the drug.

4 hours

Viagra has a half-life of about four hours, which means that every four hours after taking it, the drug reduces by 50%. But it’s still possible to have sex.

*** This is the one thing women REALLY look for in a man ***

10 hours

Scientists found that after 10 hours men could still get a strong erection. In fact, it was just as easy as when they got one 2 hours after dosing up.

12 hours

Many lads can still get it up, but it won’t last as long. The average time that an erection lasts for is 16 minutes.

24 hours

After one day the effects of sildenafil will have worn off. Almost all traces of the drug disappear from the blood stream, along with any boost to sexual performance.

But how does Viagra actually work?

When you swallow it in pill form, the cGMP component dilates the blood vessels and allows blood to flow more easily.

While this is happening, the drug stops the function of an enzyme in the penis called PDE5, which reduces blood flow.

So it allows blood to flow more freely into the penis, making it easier for men to achieve an erection.

Of course, everyone’s dose of the little blue pill is different and factors like age, general health and other medications can all have an impact on how effective it is for you.

Food also changes the way you react to it. Taking Viagra with a meal can mean you have to wait longer for it to kick in.

While Viagra is a widely accepted treatment for erectile dysfunction, many men still struggle to discuss the health issue openly.

Each date costs an average of £51.68. And suitors are likely to invest in at least one gift in order to win someone over.

When the cost is added up, the love milestone comes with a total bill of £276.92, the study by One4all, the Post Office gift card found.

Spokesman Aoife Davey, said: “While it’s always about the thought that counts, it shows many are really quite invested – both emotionally and financially – in finding Mr or Mrs Right.”

The research also found that men fork out £9 more than women on gifts, and £20 more per date. Even when they aren’t serious about a relationship, men will still spend £10 more than women per date.

Ms Davey added: “It’s intriguing that chivalry is still thriving in 2016. Men are still forking out more than women in order to impress.”

The study showed taking a date out for dinner or choosing a night in with home cooking were the most popular ways to show commitment to a relationship. Taking someone to a nightclub or the cinema were the least popular dates for showing you are serious.","vulgar"

Lots of guys worry about going soft and it’s thought about one in 10 men across the world suffer from erectile dysfunction.

But fear not because a recent study by scientists at Harvard and the University of East Anglia looked into the best grub to chow down on if you want to stay hard.

Researchers found that men who indulged in a glass of red wine and regularly chomped on citrus fruits were much less likely to develop erectile dysfunction.

*** Best sex positions for every penis size ***

In fact, if guys had between three and four portions of flavonoid-rich foods each week they’d reduce the risk of the problem by 21%.

Professor Aedin Cassidy explained: ""This is the first study to look at the association between flavonoids and erectile dysfunction, which affects up to half of all middle-aged and older men.

""Men who regularly consumed foods high in these flavonoids were less likely to suffer erectile dysfunction. In terms of quantities, we're talking just a few portions a week.""

Here are the best foods and drinks for a healthy penis:

1. Coffee

A kick of caffeine can perk you up in more ways than one.

Not only does coffee boost your metabolism and get your blood pumping, it can also make you last longer in the sack.

A hot cup can release fat stores giving you more energy to keep going all night.

2. Oysters

Everyone knows they’re an aphrodisiac, but did you know they could improve your going power? Oysters are rich in zinc and vitamin B6 are vital for testosterone which makes sure you’re sex drive stays revved up.

3. Pork

Eating pig, which contains vitamin B1, keeps your nervous system healthy and makes sure your sperm is firing full throttle. If you can’t or don’t eat pork, you can eat beans or wholemeal bread instead.

4. Onions

Onions and garlic contain the phytochemical called allicin which thins the blood and enhances your circulation. This means it’s less likely to clot or clog.

Chew on some parsley or peppermints afterwards to freshen your breath before the bedroom.

5. Wine

Believe it or not, red wine works in the same way that viagra does. It’s a great source of the antioxidant resveratrol which helps to open the arteries by enhancing the production of nitric oxide.

Nitric oxide lets blood vessels expand, which is how viagra works.

But while the little blue pill only works on tiny blood vessels, resveratrol helps your main arteries too.

The world’s first breathalyser-activated condom vending machine has launched to help you hold back when you've had too much.

Earlier this week a shocking survey by Match.com revealed that over a third of shy singles have never slept with someone for the first time without getting tipsy first.

Most men and women revealed that they liked the way getting drunk lessened their inhibitions before sex, with some thinking that they perform better and that their partner becomes more adventurous in the sack.

In a bid to encourage sober sex, the dating website invented “Johnny Be Good” to judge how boozed up you are before letting you have a free rubber.

After blowing on the panel, it gives you a reading from “teetotal” to “game over” but you’ll only be allowed a condom if you’re under the legal driving limit.

The gadget has popped up in The Brass Monkey pub in London Victoria if you fancy paying it a visit, with potential to be rolled out across the country.

Madeleine Mason, dating psychologist, said: ""The feeling of fear and anxiety usually lies behind the lack of confidence people are experiencing, which from a physiological perspective is an activation of the nervous system (breathing and heart beat speeds up creating a form of arousal).

""The impulse is to calm the nervous system down by consuming alcohol.""

But is it a good idea? It’s important that couples use protection whether they’re drunk or not – especially considering that the rates of sexually transmitted infections are continually on the rise in the UK.

In fact, London bagged the title for the highest rate of STIs in the country and by a long stretch, in a survey published earlier this week.

Research showed that there were 13.96 cases of STIs per 1,000 people in the British capital – so one in four were diagnosed with a new disease over the course of the year.

*** Your most embarrassing sexual health questions answered ***

Considering that there’s a staggering 8.6million people living in the city it means that you’re much more likely to catch an infection if you have sex with a Londoner without using protection.

Brigitte Bard, founder of Sexual Health Revolution, Last Taboo and CEO of BioSure UK, told Dailystar.co.uk: “If you think you have an STI, the most important thing is to get tested so you can get treated.

“This protects your own health and stops you passing the infection on to anyone else.""

""The sooner treatment starts, the better the outcomes,"" she continued. “You can get tested at any local sexual health clinic, some GP surgeries also offer testing services or alternatively if you can’t get to a clinic there are many self tests available now – but make sure they are CE marked so you know your result is accurate.”","vulgar"

Internet fan “okcookies” took to the social media site to fume about a conversation she overheard between two of her co-workers.

The misinformed pair believed that the darker a woman’s labia, the more men she’d slept with. But she pointed out: “I've had darker and external labia for as long as I can remember yet I have zero previous sex partners.

“There seems to be too many people who equate larger labia with number of sex partner.”

*** Women are sticking vodka-soaked tampons up their vaginas – and the effects are shocking ***

Another thread pointed out that ""a lot of people seem to be under the impression that a female's anatomy changes drastically with every sexual experience she has”.

So is there any truth in it at all, and can your vagina really give away your sexual experiences? In a word, no.

*** The real cost of having a vagina: This is how much women spend on their lady bits ***

Dr. Toli Onon, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), confirmed that it’s a myth.

""There is no evidence that the labia undergoes any permanent changes as a result of having sex,"" she told Broadly.

""During orgasm, the labia will become engorged with blood, which will make them appear larger and darker, but this is not long-lasting.""

Meanwhile London Gynaecology consultant Pradnya Pisal explained that the appearance of labia can change – but not due to sex.

She said that puberty, pregnancy and weight gain can affect the overall look of the vagina.

“If you put on fat, you put on fat everywhere else as well, and that will change the way the vulva and labia appear,” Pradnya told the publication.

But basically vaginas vary from woman to woman just like every other body part and the amount of people you’ve slept with isn’t going to change that.

If you’re worried that your lady bits might not be “normal” then you’ll be pleased to know that there’s no such thing.

There are two sets of lips or labia, the outer and inner, but in reality there is a huge variation in shape, size and colour.

If the labia are longer the skin may be darker and slightly more stretchy, which people worry about, but it's perfectly natural.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/490480/UK-England-where-area-highest-rate-STIs-sexual-health","You’re more likely to get an STI if you live in THIS city","There’s one place in the UK that has a soaring rate of sexually transmitted infections. Whether it’s herpes, Chlamydia or HIV, the growing number of men and women putting themselves at risk through unsafe sex is worrying.

According to the latest report by Public Health England (PHE) nearly 440,000 people were diagnosed with an STI across the nation in 2014.

But we've crunched the numbers to find out which area is the most high-risk when it comes to sexual health.

*** This is why YOU probably have herpes and don’t know about it ***

It turns out that London bagged the title for the highest rate of STIs – and by a long stretch.

Research showed that there were 13.96 cases of STIs per 1,000 people in the British capital – so one in four were diagnosed with a new STI over the course of the year.

Considering that there’s a staggering 8.6million people living in the city it means that you’re much more likely to catch a disease if you have sex with a Londoner without using protection.

Meanwhile the North West came in second with 8.3 cases per 1,000 people and Yorkshire and Humber followed closely behind with 7.63 cases.

The South West, East Midlands and the East of England all saw figures under 7 cases per 1,000 people.

And despite London being the biggest culprit of STIs, the rest of the South East saw just 5.95 cases – less than half of London’s figures.

Across the world it’s thought that more than half of all people will have an STD in their lifetime and roughly one million people catch a type of sexual infection every day.

Experts reckon that the rise in STIs is down to less couples using condoms so there’s more reason than ever to rubber up.

*** Herpes dating is now a thing – you won't believe how popular it is ***

Risky sexual behaviour while under the influence of drugs is also an “emerging problem” said a PHE spokeswoman.

*** The rise of 'chemsex': Craze sees 72 hour drug-fuelled sex sessions sweep UK ***

Brigitte Bard, founder of Sexual Health Revolution, Last Taboo and CEO of BioSure UK, said: “If you think you have an STI, the most important thing is to get tested so you can get treated.

“This protects your own health and stops you passing the infection on to anyone else.""

She continued: ""The sooner treatment starts, the better the outcomes.

“You can get tested at any local sexual health clinic, some GP surgeries also offer testing services or alternatively if you can’t get to a clinic there are many self tests available now – but make sure they are CE marked so you know your result is accurate.”

According to a shocking new survey by Match.com, over a third of shy singles have never slept with someone for the first time completely sober.

Without alcohol, lads and ladies confessed that they find dating tricky and they wouldn’t have the confidence to approach someone in a bar.

Which is probably why a whopping 73% of singletons think alcohol makes it easier for them to date.

*** How to burn off your booze calories in the bedroom ***

Most men and women revealed that they liked how getting drunk lessened their inhibitions before sex, with some thinking that they perform better and that their partner becomes more adventurous in the sack.

In fact, the average date involves three liquors to loosen things up before making love.

And 38% can’t get naked without having a tipple beforehand which is probably why nearly half (42%) of people said their recent sexual experiences have taken place under the influence.

When it comes to the battle of the sexes, men are the least likely to have sober sex with 47% drinking beforehand compared to 36% of women.

Match.com’s dating expert Kate Taylor said: “This is sobering news.

“Brits’ reliance on alcohol for dating suggests that almost none of us has the confidence to express ourselves without a drink.

""Try not to hide your shyness behind a shandy.

“Instead, learn to love your imperfections and trust that others will love them too, even over just a coffee.""

Here are Kate’s top tips for dating with confidence and without a drink:

1. Give yourself a natural boost by getting your endorphins going before a date.

Walk to wherever you’re meeting your date, or go for a light jog just before. This will help to raise your endorphins, making you feel happier and more confident overall.

2. Use the journey to your date as a time to calm down.

Call a supportive friend who can remind you why you’re amazing. Read some positive-thinking mantras online.

Keep a list of your three best qualities stored on your phone. Whenever you notice you’re thinking negatively about yourself, make a conscious effort to focus on something good about yourself instead.

3. Heavy breathing on your date won’t calm your nerves.

Instead, try the “4-7-8” breathing technique from Dr Andrew Weil. Inhale through your nose for four counts.

Hold your breath for seven counts. Then, exhale while counting to eight. Repeat the cycle three times.

Do it just before you meet your date, and every time you use the bathroom.

4. Dinner date?

You can order positivity-inspiring food without looking scarily vegan.

Go for side-orders of green leafy veg, add extra salad (lettuce is very calming), choose a granary roll from the bread basket, or opt for oily fish – like smoked salmon – as a starter.

5. If you need alcohol to feel uninhibited in bed, chances are you’re simply going to bed too soon.

Wait a few more dates. When you know your partner has seen the good and bad sides of your personality and adores you anyway, you’ll feel much more relaxed, and less performance-oriented, under the covers.","vulgar"

*** Hangover cures: 10 bizarre things that will make you feel human again ***

SEX: More than 288 calories per hour

You'd have to go on a 40 minute jog to burn this many calories, but most people would agree this type of activity is much more fun.

Obviously the longer and more vigorous the session, the more fat you will burn. There are also some sex positions which are better at burning calories.

Girl On Top is the best for working out your calfs and quads and if you squeeze your legs into your man's sides is will work your core harder.

This position burns about 207 calories in just 30 minutes. So you'll be sexing your way to a six-pack in no time.

Experts also estimate that women who orgasm during sex burn more calories during lovemaking than those who don't. So make sure he knows what he's doing.

Margarita cocktail (180 calories) = 37 minutes 30 seconds

ORAL SEX: 200 calories per hour

A woman can burn a whopping 200 calories an hour from performing oral sex. That's the equivalent of walking for 70 minutes or doing 30 hardcore minutes on the rowing machine.

If you want to ramp it up even further, Los Angeles–based sexologist Jaiya Kinzbach, recommends doing push-ups during the act or even trying out some yoga.

""You can do a little yoga,"" she told Womanday.com. ""Try plank position into downward facing dog, and back into plank where you can lower down and do some oral stimulation.""

You can blast an extra 71 calories by adding the occasional push-up and a further 35 doing some yoga moves.

That might seem like a lot of kissing, but when you're in the throes of love it certainly isn't a chore.

""If the kissing is vigorous and involves some petting, it could be even closer to 90 calories burned in an hour,"" added Jaiya.

Doing push-ups on top of him and getting a kiss as a reward can also ramp up your calorie-burning potential to around 171 calories in 30 minutes.

Well that’s all about to change because clothes for your schlong are going to be the next big thing (apparently).

Pioneering the movement is sex-toy brand Lelo, who’ve tailored a tiny tuxedo just for your todger. The suit takes inspiration from Scotland’s favourite willy warmers which are still sold widely in the UK.

Its origins date back to the 12th century, where shepherds would wear a knitted cover to protect their assets against frostbite during the freezing winter months.

The stylish item, dubbed TUX, simply slips onto your manhood and is held in place by a stretchy cord meaning that it fits a full range of penis sizes.

It’s made from sophisticated satin and accessorised with a bow tie to make any gent’s genitalia look suave.

*** 'D*ckorate' your manhood: Bizarre new sex trend gives you a pretty penis ***

Steve Thomson, Lelo’s chief marketing officer, explained: “We wanted to bring this concept to a global audience, while updating it with a stylish and modern twist.

“It was actually much more complicated than it sounds, from selecting the materials to finalising the cut, and TUX went through multiple design iterations before the finished product.

“In 2016, it really is incredible the concept of male intimate apparel has not been explored further.”

“Valentine’s Day can become a routine within a routine for many, and at Lelo with both our awarding-winning pleasure objects and now TUX, we stand for adding a burst of excitement,” he added.

“We believe our customers will embrace TUX as a way of keeping fantasy, exploration and humor central to their relationships.”

Meanwhile sexpert Tristan Taormino thinks that styling up your schlong could do wonders for your sex life.

He said: “There is all this emphasis on women dressing up in lingerie, sexy undies, or role-play costumes to entice their partners or revive a spark, but I say it's equally important for men.

“Women love to be seduced by their partners. Knowing that a man has made extra effort to dress for sex is a real turn-on.”

The phallic object contains ancient herbs such as high-quality Manjakani and pearl powder which has been used by women in Asia, Arabia and Persia for generations.

According to vaginal-tightening.com, which claims to be the number one best seller of these kinds of wands and sticks, there’s a range of benefits.

Not only can the bizarre device allegedly prevent infections, eliminate vaginal discharge and moisten your lady parts, but it can improve your sex life too.

*** Can you guess how big the average vagina really is? ***

They say: “Suffer no more. [Vagina sticks] will help you cleanse, stimulate and tighten your vagina.

“Both you and your partner will enjoy an increase in stimulation and pleasure during sexual intercourse.”

The vagina stick makers warn that you shouldn’t leave it inside you for any longer than two minutes but suggest that it should be inserted every three to four days for lasting results.

But how does it work?

“By removing dead cells and replacing them with newer ones, by healing internal wounds, preventing infection and itching, encouraging natural lubrication, promoting attractive odour, and delaying the effects of ageing these vaginal tightening products will help you make your vagina tighter,” the website explains.

A spokesperson for the company stressed that it's ""completely safe"".

He said: ""The only issues we had are allergic reactions to the natural ingredients, but it happens once a year, so it should be ok.

""The natural ingredients of the stick have been used for centuries in Indonesia and Asia in general to tighten the vagina after childbirth.

""The astringent property of the ingredients help tighten the skin and at the same time to cleanse the vagina.""

But the Japanese vagina stick is part of a worrying new trend which is seeing women “detoxing” their downstairs.

And what’s most alarming is that experts think that the weird craze could actually damage women’s health.

Dr Vanessa Mackay, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) told Dailystar.co.uk: “The vagina is designed to clean itself with natural secretions and should not require a ‘detox’.

“It contains good bacteria, which are there to protect it. If these bacteria are disturbed it can lead to infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or thrush, and inflammation.""

She continued: “Perfumed products, soaps, gels, antiseptics, and vaginal douches can all affect the pH levels and the healthy balance of bacteria in the vagina, and cause irritation.

“Anyone who is worried about the way their vagina smells, or has noticed irritation or itching, should seek advice from their GP or pharmacist as they may have an infection that needs treatment.”

Of course, there are other ways to combat a loose vagina.

He tragically died within 24 hours of getting home.

His distraught daughter Elizabeth is now suing Pennine Acute NHS Trust because she believes her dad died prematurely due to its actions.

Widower Mr Taylor fell ill last May just a few weeks after his wife Janet lost her own battle with cancer.

In early June doctors at the North Manchester General Hospital told him he had advanced lung cancer which had spread.

They ruled out chemotherapy as it would only prolong his life by a few months.

But two weeks later the hospital rang to say Mr Taylor from Bury did not have cancer at all but lymphoma – a disease that could be treated.

As Mr Taylor prepared for his treatment, the hospital threw the bombshell that he did have incurable lung cancer after all.

He was admitted to hospital a fortnight later for a separate health matter which he believed would take a couple of hours.

But when doctors discharged him they ordered transport provider Arriva to take him home.

The company failed to pick up the message until the following morning.

After 15 hours waiting, Mr Taylor arrived home but died 21 hours later.

The hospital carried out an investigation and apologised saying lessons had been learnt.

“They can apologise and send me condolences but it means nothing. Their actions caused the premature death of my dad,” said 36-year-old Elizabeth.

“It is impossible to describe the psychological, physical and emotional strain we have been put under when all this was actually preventable.

Today she found herself in court and was told prosecutors want her to pay an 800,000 yen (£4,600) fine for breaking obscenity laws.

She has designed a number of pieces of 3D art, based on her vagina, including pink triangle-shaped ornaments.

Her trademark Deco-Man artworks translated as ""decorated vagina"" as manko is the Japanese word for the lady parts.

Igarashi, who uses the nickname Rokudenashiko (Good For Nothing Girl), has fallen foul of Japan's draconian laws on obscenity.

The Japanese are famously prudish and even porn movies have to be pixelated to prevent lady parts, or penises, being shown.

A po-faced prosecutor told Tokyo District Court today: ""The shape is easy to clearly understand. Rather than an ornament it emphasises the original.”

Igarashi was originally arrested in July 2014 by for e-mailing links for the download of the images to art project donors.

Igarashi, 44, was seeking investors to help fund the creation of a kayak based on her vag.

As a result of the publicity the case has gained she has been offered more than a million yen (£6,000) from 32 donors.

The feisty artist was arrested again five months later for displaying a plaster cast of her vagina in an exhibition at an adult shop in Tokyo.

Igarashi told the court: ""Having created works that defy the image associated with genitalia, I cannot agree with my arrest.""

Her lawyer told the court she denied the art was obscene and added: ""The constitution guarantees freedom of expression.""

At a previous hearing a professor of art history testified on her behalf that the ornaments ""do not appear to be obscene (materials) that cause sexual arousal"".

The court will decide in May if she has to pay the fine.

Japan's obscenity laws are so weird that genitalia cannot be showed in porn but manga comics are perfectly free to show images which would be considered child abuse in Britain.

In 2014 Japan finally introduced laws which banned child porn but the law gives an exemption for the country's enormous manga and anime industry.","dubious"

The prints – larger than a human footprint – are in a single line, one in front of the other.

Mr Berry claims no four-legged creature could have left the trail.

A local yak herder confirmed they were Yeti tracks – and revealed he saw the Abominable Snowman in the area 11 years.

The tracks were on Gangkhar Puensum in the Himalayas – the world’s highest unclimbed mountain.

The remote peak lies in the ancient mountain kingdom of Bhutan – where even the royal family believes the Yeti lives.

Mr Berry's local guide spotted 17,800ft up a mountain pass, 200 yards away across an impassible chasm.

The 66-year-old, who owns trekking firm Mountain Kingdom, said: ""The local people said we were the first to ever set foot on that pass.

""I had always thought that stories about the yeti were a bit of old bunkum, but there is no denying these tracks existed.

""The prints were clearly visible with the naked eye from where we were standing on a pass at 17,800ft.

""There was a vertical drop in front of us – not to mention a very serious mountainside to cross – so we could not get to them.""

A yak herder told Mr Berry he had seen the Yeti – or Migo as it is known in Bhutan – in the pass 11 years earlier.

The legendary beast had dun brown-coloured hair and a face like a cat or dog, was human height.

It stared straight at him.

The herder said Migo place one foot in front of the other – just like the tracks Mr Berry saw.

Mr Berry said: ""I showed him the pictures from my camera and he said: 'Yes, these are Migo tracks.'""

The Yeti has fascinated the western world since 1921 – when a Royal Geographical Society expedition found footprints made by a ""wild man of the snows"".

Tibetan folklore has it that the yeti is nocturnal, whistles, and can kill with a single punch.

Sherpa tradition holds that the yeti will only show itself to those who believe in it.

Possible explanations for yeti tracks include melting snow, overlapping hind and forefeet animal tracks and prints left by nomads wearing snow sandals.","dubious"

The firm was set up last year and is doing a roaring trade, simply adapting company logos with penises and balls.

Penised was set up by two IT professionals who, for obvious reasons, choose to remain anonymous and go by the names Phropenius and Coxworth.

The pair realised there was money to be made in mocking fancy company logos by adding in something phallic.

Penised

They started off with commissions for big corporations like BP, Starbucks and Pepsi.

But after a while they started getting jobs from people who wanted logos for much smaller companies, sometimes that of their own but more often than not that of their bitter rivals.

""Can you think of a better way to stick it to someone? No matter what age or gender, penises never get old (figuratively speaking),"" jokes Coxworth.

""It's the ultimate way to poke fun at somebody. Everybody likes to get penis jokes,"" adds Phropenius.

Penised

On their website they say: ""Just like in real life, penises come in all shapes and sizes. Some take longer, some shorter, some harder. It comes when its ready. We will finesse the process. In the end, the goal is to please the customer but if it comes too quickly we apologise, that usually never happens.""

Asked if there were ever any logos which were phallic-proof, Phropenius told the Huffington Post: ""No. We get better with time. Our first few logos we had to take a few minutes to actually think where a penis might fit in or where the balls might go. But now we have a vision of the logo within 30 seconds. It's only getting easier.""

But the pair are struggling to keep up with demand, hence the job advert.

Penised

They are offering a freelance position, need someone who is good in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator and add: ""Bonus points if you can yank out a penis logo in less than an hour"".

So if you're an overgrown schoolboy – or girl – who never stopped drawing phalluses on things, better send your CV off to the guys at Penised.

It’s not unusual to expect shooting victims to spend days, weeks or maybe years recovering from serious mental and physical agony.

But Devon Hawkins calmly describes getting shot as if it were an everyday routine after strolling into a TV interview this week

The young father was “chillin’” and “kickin’” at 12.30am on Friday in his Illinois flat in the USA when he was shot through his back window and through the chest.

He was rushed to hospital but then discharged.

Bizarrely, he resurfaces later that morning at 5am to stroll into a live TV broadcast with journalist Reyna Harvey on American TV network KHQA.

The hooded gentleman casually smokes throughout the interview.

When asked what happened, Devon says: “You know, I’m in the room chillin’, kickin’ like I usually do, drinking. Then someone shot right through my back window and hit me in the chest.

""I’m like s***. Get my son out of the room.”

He happily lifts his shirt up to show off his bloodied wound when Harvey asks why the incident happened.

“I think they want me dead. Or some other stuff. I don’t know,” he adds.","dubious"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/502381/iPhone-launch-5-things-need-to-know-major-Apple-event","iPhone launch: 5 things you need to know about tomorrow's major Apple event","There's a big night ahead for Apple fans as the US tech giant looks set to launch a range of new and updated gadgets.

We're expecting new phones, tablets and Apple Watch accessories to be unveiled along with news on what to expect from the next iOS software upgrade.

There could also be some good news if you're a little low on cash.

Apple may be about to bring the iPhone on a budget with rumours suggesting the firm may slash the price of some of its older smartphone ranges.

Here's a full guide to tomorrow's big event.

Apple's event kicks off at the firm's headquarters in Cupertino, San Francisco at 10am local time.

For Brits wanting to tune in things start here at 6pm.

As always, Tim Cook's keynote speech will be live-streamed to the world.

But remember – streaming the Apple Event requires an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or later, a Mac with Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X v10.8.5 or later, or a PC with Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.

WILL THERE BE A NEW iPHONE?

Don't expect a new flagship but Apple certainly looks set to launch a smaller iPhone called the SE.

This new device is rumoured to look similar to Apple's older iPhone 5s and feature a 4-inch Retina display.

Although things are likely to stay the same on the outside, there could be some big upgrades on the inside with better camera and faster processor expected to be included.

A pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is not believed to have made the cut as this will help distinguish the iPhone SE from the company's flagship iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models.

But an NFC chip – and therefore, Apple Pay – will ship with the long-rumoured iPhone SE.

Expect the SE to land in your pocket with Apple's usual Space Grey, Silver, Gold and Rose Gold colour schemes.

If your tablet is on its last legs there could be some good news as a new iPad Air may be coming soon.

There have been plenty of rumours about this new 9.7-inch tablet including it will be a like mini version of the iPad Pro.

This will allow users to connect accessories to the tablet via the small three-pin Smart Connector and Apple Pencil support is also expected to feature.

The iPad Air 2 was first introduced in October 2014.

That makes the iPad Air 2 the longest Apple has gone without updating its iPad hardware since the first model was unveiled, back in 2010.

We're not expecting a new Apple Watch but there could still be a big wearable announcement.

The invites that Apple sent out to media included the words ""Let us loop you in"" which suggest some new straps could be on their way.

The Apple Watch could also be in for a software upgrade which will bring added features to your wrist.

BUDGET iPHONES?

With its flagship smartphones starting at a rather hefty £539, Apple's best-selling iPhone certainly isn't cheap – but that could be about to change.

If Apple does unveil a new 4-inch iPhone we could see the US technology firm slashing the price of the older iPhone 5S.

In fact, technology analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities believes the iPhone 5S will be cut to a staggering £160.

If his prediction is right, the iPhone 5S – the flagship device when it was launched back in September 2013 – will become the cheapest iPhone yet.

At the time of writing, the cheapest iPhone available from Apple online and retail stores starts at £379.","geeky"

T-Mobile has confirmed that it's now allowing customers in the US to binge on porn without fear of running out of data.

The firm introduced its ""Binge On"" service last year which lets customers stream services such as Netflix and YouTube without eating into their data packages.

But T-Mobile has now added some extra websites to its ""Binge On"" catalogue including porn site MiKandi.

MiKandi is an online X-rated app store and movie streaming service and, starting now, T-Mobile customers can get DVD-quality porn streamed over T-Mobile’s network for free.

Speaking about T-Mobile's decision MiKandi CEO Jesse Adams said: “When mainstream tech companies announce new platforms it tends to be another way to censor your online experience,

“T-Mobile is treating adults like adults and we hope that other tech companies follow in their footsteps.”

Sadly, if you were hoping to enjoy the same experience in the UK you're going to be disappointed.

T-Mobile in the UK is now owned by EE and there's no sign of the same offer from the UK's biggest network.

In fact, EE actively blocks adult content with users having opt in before watching porn on their phones.

The news comes as another big name in tech is helping users watch adult content.

It's been revealed that users in the US are getting thousands of extra films to watch and paying less than UK users.

In fact, US Netflix fans get around 5,600 films and TV shows while Brits can only view 3,000.

What makes this worse is that our friends across the pond pay £7.05 per month – the same standard fee in the UK is £7.49.

Netflix doesn't release official numbers of how many shows are available but an investigation by The Sun has revealed the shocking differences.

However, Netflix has hit back at the criticism saying that there are many titles that appear in the UK that are not available in the US and in some cases its actually better news for UK than US.

Shows including Better Call Saul, Shadow Hunters, Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Homeland are all available in the UK but not in the US.

Many Netflix fans have been using VPN's to access extra content in other countries.

But an increasing number of users have noticed an error message when attempting to watch shows on their accounts.

Customers are reportedly seeing a streaming error, which reads: ""You seem to be using an unblocker or proxy.

""Please turn off any of these services and try again. For more help, visit netflix.com/proxy.

Nike has just announced the launch of its new HyperAdapt 1.0 trainer which will land in shops this summer.

The new tech trainers work just like the movie and automatically tighten the laces the minute you put your foot inside the shoe.

“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten,” explains Tiffany Beers, Senior Innovator, NIKE, Inc., and the project’s technical lead.

“Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.”

Although self-lacing shoes may seem like a gimmick Nike says the idea has huge potential for sports fans.

The firm says in the future this type of shoe would provide tailored-to-the-moment custom fit with the shoe sensing what the body needs in real-time.

This will allow the shoe to instantly loosen or tighten depending on what sport athletes are performing.

The HyperAdapt 1.0 has taken Nike over three years to develop and will be available ONLY to members of Nike+.

Its designer Tinker Hatfield reckons Nike has produced something special with the HyperAdapt saying: “Innovation at Nike is not about dreaming of tomorrow. It’s about accelerating toward it,

“We’re able to anticipate the needs of athletes because we know them better than anybody.

""Sometimes, we deliver a reality before others have even begun to imagine it.”

Nike recently unveiled a pair of limited edition self-lacing shoes from the classic scene in Back to the Future 2.

The 2015 Nike Mag will be available for a limited time only via auction.

All proceeds will go to the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.

Nike says it will release the date of the charity auction on Twitter in Spring 2016 – plenty of time to start saving those pennies.

Commenting on the unveiling of the iconic shoes, Nike President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker: “We started creating something for fiction and we turned it into fact, inventing a new technology that will benefit all athletes.”

The shoe packs a battery-powered mechanism that automatically cinches the trainer’s laces tight.

2007 The hashtag (#) makes its debut

2009 In January, the US Airways plane crash in New York’s Hudson River is shared on Twitter. The photo is the first from the scene, breaking the news before any newspapers or TV stations were aware of it.

2010 The UK general election becomes the first social media election as politicians embrace the tool to swing voters and Brits keep up to date with the latest developments by following what is happening on Twitter.

2011 In January, the Arab Spring prodemocracy movement in Egypt unfolds on Twitter. In March, Twitter shares milestone numbers for its fifth birthday, including 1 billion Tweets sent per week. And by September, the site boasts 100million monthly active users.

2012 Barack Obama marks his second term as US President by tweeting a picture of him hugging wife Michelle. It becomes the most retweeted Tweet in the site’s history so far. Pope Benedict XVI launches the first papal Twitter account (@pontifex), which has been continued by his successor, Pope Francis.

2013 Twitter reports a whopping 500 million tweets are sent every day.

2014 To celebrate its eighth birthday, Twitter invites you to find your #FirstTweet – or that of anyone else. Ellen DeGeneres’ star-studded selfie at the Oscars (see main feature) becomes – and remains – the most retweeted tweet ever.

2015 Twitter launches a raft of new features including polls, birthdays and highlights – a summary of the best of Twitter.

2016 Twitter celebrates its 10th birthday.

TWITTER’S 10 years history is littered with moments we’ll never forget. Here are some of our favourites...

Kim Kardashian (and her bum)

KK is the undisputed queen of Twitter posting some of the most controversial posts. The most recent was her nude selfie this month, captioned: “When you’re like I have nothing to wear LOL”. She also allegedly “broke the internet” with another naked pic for Paper magazine. And most of us have seen more of her bum than we have of our own!

Kanye West rants

Never one to hold back, Kanye has used the social network to rant on subjects including his own godlike genius (“the greatest living artist of all time”), his opinions on his ex Amber Rose (“a stripper”) and his own financial affairs (he recently begged Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg for $1billion).

The Oscars selfie

In March 2014, a picture tweeted live from the Oscars ceremony by Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) with Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt and taken by Bradley Cooper is retweeted more than three million times. Ellen tweets: “If only Bradley’s arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars”.

Call me Caitlyn

Former Olympic decathlon champ Bruce Jenner announced his new transgender identity on Twitter. Said @Caitlyn_Jenner: “I’m so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can’t wait for you to get to know her/me.” The message is retweeted more than 250,000 times.

One Direction split

Nothing says modern showbiz more than the disintegration of the world’s No1 boy band – on Twitter. From Zayn Malik declaring his love for Little Mix girlfriend Perrie Edwards online, only to dump her shortly afterwards, and leave the band, to Louis and Zayn’s feud over producer Naughty Boy and their subsequent fallout, to the lads having to tell their fans not to #cutforzayn after it became a worldwide craze to show their sadness, all you needed was a phone to keep up with the latest 1D drama.

The American student remembered inserting a tampon at around 9pm before going over to her lover’s house.

But the bit of fun ended in horror when the 22-year-old realised she couldn’t find the sanitary product the morning after.

*** Women are sticking vodka-soaked tampons up their vaginas – and the effects are shocking ***

Although they didn’t have sex, the pair did indulge in a “vigorous” sex act which caused the tampon to get lodged in her cervix.

Alexia began to panic when she tried to pull out the tampon in her bathroom the next day, but couldn’t find any trace of it.

The youngster shouted for her flatmate Chantal thinking that she might be able to give her some medical help as she was studying to be a doctor.

Her friend advised her to keep trying to pull it out so Alexia “pried and poked and jabbed” for 10 minutes until the pain reduced her to tears.

*** Woman nearly died after leaving rotting black tampon inside her for nine days ***

Then it dawned on her that the tampon might not be inside her at all and it may have fallen out in his bed – but she refused to text him to ask.

Fearing that she might have Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) Alexia headed to the hospital with Chantal in tow.

When she saw the doctor, she explained the situation.

Writing for Elite Daily, Alexia remembered: “I started rambling, in one giant, self-conscious breath: ‘Well, I put in a tampon last night at, like, 9pm?

""'And then I hooked up with this guy, and I guess he was going really hard with his fingers, so now I think he shoved it really far up in my vagina because I tried to get it out but I can’t.

""'I can’t even see it. So it could really be in there.’”

The medic asked her to remove her underwear and change into a hospital gown before he peered inside and finally pulled out the “mummified tampon” which she said looked like a dead rabbit’s foot.

Alexia asked the doctor how far the tampon had been stuck inside her and he replied: “Oh, you were never going to get that yourself.

“It was all the way at your cervix, and the string was pretty tightly wrapped around the cotton. You must have been going at it really vigorously.”

*** Teen wants 85p Aldi tampons banned after they 'ripped in half inside her' ***

The 28-year-old was left paralysed with doctors warning that she would never walk again.

As well as breaking a number of bones, she shockingly injured her vagina and half of her labia was sliced off meaning she couldn’t have sex for a year.

Megan said: ""I was nervous about having sex again. I was done with men. I thought no man would be interested in me.""

When Megan was thrown from the speeding van she slammed into a speed sign, breaking her spinal cord, shoulder, collar bone and slicing off her left labia.

She was also told that she'd broken six ribs – and if she'd broken another she'd have died.

The American beauty from Flordia had 18 hours of surgery to realign her back with metal rods as well as a separate procedure to construct her new labia.

She said: ""They took skin from my back to make me a new labia, and you would never know in a million years I'd had surgery there.

""I had 15 stitches put in and was swollen for a fortnight.

""I was told I would never walk again. I was devastated.

""I'd been so independent so this was a big deal. I'd lost the use of my bowels and bladder and was given a catheter. I felt hopeless.""

*** Gran who uses Tinder to meet toyboys opens up about sex with younger men ***

But now Megan finally has her sex drive back after meeting now-husband Ron, 38, and the pair are hoping to start a family.

Megan said: ""Ron and I want children and I think we'll start trying for a family later this year.

""I've been humbled by this experience. I will live in chronic pain and I miss running and dancing in high heels, but I'm very happy to be alive. I could have died that day.

""I continue to get stronger and better every day.""

She admitted she was so anxious about her first date with Ron that she almost cancelled – but luckily a friend persuaded her to go.

Megan explained: ”I thought no-one would be interested in me. I was paraplegic and didn't feel like a woman.

""I was embarrassed about being in a wheelchair so I used my walker on our first date to walk from the car in to the restaurant.

""On our second date, I was determined to use my cane.

""Though I was sweating and in a lot of pain, I wanted to show I was an independent woman and I didn't need a man to look after me.

""After that, Rod encouraged me to use my cane. He was so supportive. He's a good guy.""

From there, Megan went from strength to strength and regained the use of her bladder and bowels.

Then on her 25th birthday – just a year after she was told she'd never walk again - she decided to stop using her cane.

Megan said: ”We were going out to a restaurant to celebrate, and I wanted to walk on my own.

""It wasn't pretty, and I think you'd have been able to tell something was wrong but I woke up the morning of my birthday and decided I wouldn't use my cane any more.""

And now Megan has made a complete recovery and you would never know what she has been through to look at her.

Reflecting on her ordeal, she said: ""Miracles aren't handed to you on a silver plate, you have to work for them.

""I think I was in denial that I would never walk again and I think that's what got me to where I am now.

""After I was finally able to walk on my own, without a frame or cane, I went to see my surgeon and he was in tears.

""I believe in mind over matter and getting what you want.""","boorish"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/501683/St-Patricks-Day-what-to-do-celebrate-drink-food","St Patrick's Day guide: How to party like the Irish","GUINNESS: The stout is pretty much the national drink of Ireland.

Here’s how to pour a perfect pint from a can: Chill your Guinness in the fridge for at least four hours, until the liquid reaches between 5C and 7C.

After opening the can on a flat surface, you’ll hear the widget jet nitrogen through the beer in the can. Tilt a clean dry glass to a 45-degree angle. Pour slowly and steadily. Let the liquid settle for around 60 seconds and watch as the surge forms the famous white head.

Irish Coffee: Mix a hot coffee with some Irish whiskey, sugar and top with thick cream.

Baileys Irish cream: The Irish liqueur is best served over ice.

Irish whiskey: Top brands include Jameson, Powers and Tullamore Dew.

Top cocktail: Try a Guinness-themed Black Velvet, invented in 1861 to celebrate the life of Prince Albert. Ingredients: One part Guinness, one part champagne and a splash of cassis.

Method: Make sure all ingredients are well chilled. Start by mixing the cassis with the Guinness to increase the density of the drink. Slowly pour the Guinness and cassis mix down the side of a champagne flute until it half fills the glass. Top with champagne, poured over a spoon.

HERE are two perfect recipes to help you celebrate the day…

Beef and Guinness stew Serves four people Ingredients: 200ml of Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, 400g stewing diced beef, one diced onion, one large carrot diced, one large celery diced, one large parsnip diced, one litre of thick beef stock, sprigs of fresh thyme and rosemary and Champ potato (creamed mash potato and spring onion).

Method: Stir fry the beef, add the vegetables & cook till tender, then pour the Guinness and reduce by half. Add the beef stock & herbs and simmer slowly for between an hour and an hour and a half. Serve with the Champ potato and honey-roasted carrots and parsnips.

Guinness burger Ingredients: 1kg of minced Irish beef, 50ml Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, a splash of Tabasco Sauce, a sprig of fresh thyme, chopped, a splash of Worcestershire Sauce, salt and pepper.

Method: Combine all the ingredients and mix well. Mould the mixture into small individual patties. Cook the burgers for around five minutes on both sides on a barbeque until they are cooked through.

GO green: Wear some gear featuring the national colour. You could just don a fun leprechaun hat.

Paint your nails: Show your support by going for the colours of the Irish tricolour, white, green and orange, or go for some green eye shadow. You could even get a fake shamrock tattoo for the day!

Show off your moves: The Irish are a musical nation. As the evening wears on encourage your friends to show off some of their Riverdance moves like Michael Flatley, 57.

Sing a ditty: After a few sips of Guinness, encourage a sing-a-long of Irish favourites like Danny Boy, Dirty Old Town made popular by The Dubliners, or anything by The Pogues.

Speak some Irish: Raise your glass with a cry of “sláinte” which means “good health” in Irish Gaelic.

Tell a few jokes: Try this trio for starters…

• Question: How can you tell if an Irishman is having a good time? Answer: He’s Dublin over with laughter!

• Question: What’s a leprechaun’s favourite kind of music? Answer: Sham-rock and roll.

Flirt Irish style: Try some Irish-themed chat up lines like these…

1. Top of the morning to you... actually, I’d like to be on top of you in the morning.

2. My lips are like the Blarney Stone. Kiss them for good luck and the gift of the gab.

3. It’s St Patrick’s Day! Interested in Fifty Shades Of Green?

1. St Patrick’s Day is celebrated on March 17 – generally accepted as the date of the death of Ireland’s patron saint back in 461AD.

2. He was actually born in Britain and went to Ireland as a slave. He escaped and became a priest, travelling across Ireland to convert the population to Christianity.

3. The popularity of the shamrock came from the legend that St Patrick used the three leaves to explain the Holy Trinity – the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

4. Legend also has it that he banished serpents from Ireland, though experts say there weren’t any snakes there in his day.

5. The tradition of having a bit of booze on St Patrick’s Day comes from the tale that he once told off an innkeeper who served a short measure of whiskey.

6. Toasts on St Patrick’s Day include: “May the roof above us never fall in, and may we friends beneath it never fall out.”

7. In the US more than a tenth of the population has Irish ancestry. Around six million people living in the Britain have one Irish grandparent, while nearly a million Irish-born people live here.

8. There are big St Patrick’s Day parades all over the world. In Chicago the river is dyed green.

9. March 17 is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

10. Irish-born celebrities who are sure to be celebrating include U2’s Bono, 55, actor Colin Farrell, 39, and model Vogue Williams, 30.","boorish"

From oral sex rules to strange requests, the pink-haired sex worker who earns up to £3,000 a week certainly didn't hold back in her revealing question time.

And now other prostitutes and escorts have taken to the sharing site to discuss the weird and wonderful things that happened on their first nights on the job.

While some have said they were ""shivering, shaking and sweating"", others thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

""I just got paid $900 to f*** for 2 hrs, the last hour was spent at dinner. It was so much fun and he was really nice,"" said one female sex worker.

""He had only had 3 partners. He was a little big weight wise but so much fun.""

""I'm an independent escort for the record. Stay safe and get paid,"" she added.

While a male user on Reddit, by the name ‘Aroumi’, described his first sexual encounter proudly.

He said: ""My first evening was pretty amazing… we smiled to each other in the car and started to talk. The sex was awesome.

""At the end of the act she was shaking and shivering and we were both sweating.

""I was so proud of myself, for weeks. I saw her 12 times in that year (every month) and I became excited the closer we came to that day.""

Another sex worker described how her first client paid her $200 (around £150) to spank her.

It_aint_the_whisky said: ""A guy who owned a limo company paid me $200 to spank me while nude and walk me on a dog lead around a hotel room.""

Another male sex worker Panda_Samawich, describes himself as a ""dude who took old ladies to parties"".

Talking about his first female client, he said: ""She bought me a tux and brought me to some charity party and showed me off to her friends.

""We went up to her room played a game of chess, chatted, she gave me a back rub, and sent me home with a $1,500 (£1,000) suit.""

But not all the experiences were good ones. Some found their debut daunting, with one female worker admitting she shook all the way through it.

""I literally nervous sweated and shook my whole way through the call, it was my first time and his so we were both a mess,"" she said.

""I’m sure he looked back after some more experience and laughed at how awkward it was.""

""I didn’t know if I would come back but I did, my first three calls were the same and eventually I kind of got more comfortable getting naked with strangers within minutes of meeting,"" she added.","boorish"

The buxom blonde first went under the knife when she was just 21 and since then she’s had three boob jobs, a breast lift, lip fillers, Botox and veneers.

On top of that the 42-year-old maintains her plastic-fantastic look with semi-permanent make-up, hair dye, nail extensions and daily at-home tanning sessions.

Nannette loves to show off her plastic fantastic look by uploading racy snaps of herself on Instagram – that are all taken by her children.

*** Real-life Barbie and Ken splash £209k to emulate plastic idols ***

The full-time mum said: ""People always ask me who takes my photos and I tell them it's either my husband or my kids.

""I know the other mums talk and gossip about me behind my back but I really don't care.

""Parents can think what they want and say what they want about my appearance but it doesn't bother me. I've taught my children to rise above it.

""My husband Dave and my children are just so proud of me and what I've achieved through surgery. They think I look great, my life is better than Barbie's now.""

*** Real-life Brazilian Barbie says her doll-like looks scare people ***

Nannette had been obsessed with Barbie dolls from an early age. She had over 50 of them, along with a Barbie house, car and van.

She explained: ""I loved playing with those Barbies. Growing up, I felt shy and self-conscious about my looks and wanted to be just like the dolls.

""I imagined they'd always be happy and I felt drab in comparison. I didn't like my hair colour and as a teen, I really wanted bigger breasts.

""I always knew I wanted a boob job as soon as I could. I started going on sunbeds when I was 16 to get Barbie's honey colouring.""

And when she turned 21 she began her transformation with a £2,250 boob job taking her from a B-cup to a C. Just three years later she splurged another £7,000 on a second surgery to go up to a DD.

Nannette became so obsessed with plastic surgery that she started working as a nurse for a cosmetic surgeon. And from the age of 27, she started getting regular Botox and collagen filler injections in her lips.

Nannette explained: ""I would see other people getting these treatments and thought they looked great so I wanted them too.

""And I still have them every few months when I feel I need them, at a cost of around £1,000 a time.

""I just love plastic surgery. The needle feels like a massage and once it goes in, I don't want to leave. It's very relaxing.""

Since her early 30s, Nannette has spent roughly £1,275 on hair extensions and platinum dye jobs.

She also splurges a £350 on eyelash extensions every month – all paid for by her 47-year-old husband Dave.

And Nannette plans to carry on having surgery to maintain her Barbie look.

She said: ""It's worth every penny to look like this. I feel happy and secure.

""I want to age gracefully and when the time comes for me to have a facelift, I won't hesitate to get one.

""I'm going to keep looking like a Barbie right until I'm 70, or probably longer.”

The blonde bombshell from Ohio, US, also works hard to maintain her UK size 4 figure by exercising for an hour a day.

She's 5ft 3ins, weighs just 6.5st and has a tiny 18-inch waist. Nanette usually starts the day with a protein shake for breakfast, then eats salad for lunch and chicken or fish with vegetables at dinner time.

And because of her dramatic figure and tiny waist, she can spend over £200 a month on getting her Barbie-style clothes customised by a seamstress.

Dave also treated her to three customised Barbie cars including a pink Porsche costing £175,000 and she has three walk-in wardrobes in their family home which she calls her ""Barbie playroom"".

But her husband is completely happy to fund her plastic surgery addiction.

Dave said: ""I like Nannette's look and I'm always happy to support her. She's a wonderful mother and a great wife.

""Nannette and I enjoy spending a lot of time together as a family. But we also think it's important to spend time as a couple and to remember that we're madly in love with each other.

""Nannette and I will often take our private plane and go on fun trips together.""

Last year Nannette decided to start uploading snaps showing off her plastic surgery honed body on Instagram. She now has over 27,000 followers on social media. And her husband and children help Nannette take all her sexy shots for Instagram.

She said: ""My kids think it's cool that I'm on Instagram and they all help me take my photos.

""I know my photos are a tad bit risque but I think they're all tasteful. I'm aware that people gossip about my appearance and my photos.

""I've got negative attention for my look all my life so it doesn't phase me. I'm a mum of five and I look like a fabulous Barbie. Life couldn't be better.”","boorish"

The 56-year-old estimates that she’s dated over 100 young men in the past five years and says the benefits of dating younger men are obvious.

Gaynor tends to go for men aged between 25 to 35 because they have more passion and she feels as though her lovers have given her “renewed vigour” in her senior years.

*** Married woman who has regular sex with four other people reveals kinky secrets ***

Speaking candidly about her sex life, Gaynor said: ""It's fairly simple really – they're young, fit and fun.

""Younger men have got stamina, drive, enthusiasm and are able to repeat perform.""

Describing herself as “firing on all cylinders”, Gaynor revealed that younger men are attracted to older women because they know what they want and aren't trying to tie them down.

She said: ""Older women are confident in our own skins, there's no dancing around. We know what we're going to do and how to do it.

""We're not pinning them down for dates, we're not chasing them on the phone or saying: ‘What are you doing this weekend, where are you taking me?'""

The grandma-of-three meets her men on nights out or through hook-up app Tinder and specialist dating website toyboywarehouse.com.

She goes on a couple of dates a week – though it can be more.

*** Woman sheds 11st after feeling too fat to romp with toyboy lover ***

Gaynor said: ”I always have a few on the go.

“I’m not saying you sleep with one, one night, another the next but over the course of a month you might see a couple of different people.""

Apart from age, the raunchy recruiter doesn't have a specific type. She’s been out with lawyers, bankers and fitness instructors from Ireland, Australia, Italy, Switzerland and France.

She said: ""I prefer tall and intelligent but other than that I have dated dark, blonde and a really fit ginge.

“I love muscles but don't really mind if they are lean – as long as they are keen.""

Although physical attraction is important to Gaynor, it's not all about sex.

She said: ""I'm not good with people I can't relate to. I like a brain. I like the intelligence.""

Gaynor met her first husband when she was just a teenager and was married by the age of 18. They had three children but she ended up leaving him.

Her second husband was 18 years younger than her and the couple had a son together. But after nearly 20 years it ended in divorce and Gaynor decided her love life needed a rethink.

*** Woman exposes cheating husband after discovering love letter to secret mistress ***

She said: ""I thought: I'm not going to let this get me down, I'm just going to have to turn this around so I reinvented myself – lost weight, went to the beauticians and started going out with my daughters, who at that point were in their late 20s, early 30s, because my good friends were all settled with their husbands or partners.""

Young men would approach her and after initially rebuffing their efforts Gaynor decided to give them a chance.

She said: ""In the early days when I was newly single, I was a bit wild. I'd never had a one-night stand in my youth – I didn't know what they were - though obviously I do now.""

Despite her carefree approach Gaynor admitted that she has become too involved with some of her toy boys.

She said: ""These boys don't intentionally hurt you and you have to keep your feet on the ground - even if you've got your legs in the air - but you have to be real about it.

""You're not going to keep hold of them in the real world - Madonna and Cheryl Cole might but not me.""

Gaynor also confessed that her eldest daughter Laura, 37, didn't always approve of her mum's behaviour.

Laura said: ""I just wanted my mum to be normal. I thought why couldn't she just find a man that's a similar age and maybe wants to settle down.""

But she now accepts her mum's wild ways - although she still doesn't want to see Gaynor in pulling mode.

""If I'm out with my mum she might have an encounter or a kiss but I don't like that in front of my face,” Laura said.

Gaynor, who has written a book called Sex and the Signposts about her exploits, isn't ready to give up her younger men just yet.

She said: ""It's not worth worrying about what other people think about you. You've got to do what makes you happy and young toy boys make me very happy.""","boorish"

The London-based class uses live sexual acts as the subject matter and calling on a host of porn stars, prostitutes and strippers to perform.

It’s exclusively for females only and the first woman that Lauren has lined up to model works as an escort, webcam girl and porn star – as well as being an activist.

*** Porn star with master’s degree reveals all about quitting office job to have sex on film ***

Although there will be real-time sex performances, the idea is that the artists don’t view the models in a sexual manner.

But because she was named at the time, the police told her there was “no point going through with it”.

“This idea that somebody being naked means they’re readily sexual for everyone else is an idea that needs to be undone, not just for sex workers but in general,” Lauren told Dazed and Confused.

“There will be an understanding in the room that people can’t react sexually towards them.”

Lauren, who is also vice president of Britain’s only student support group for sex workers, explained that she’ll pay the performers as close to their usual going rate as she can afford.

Youngsters are sharing snaps of their bodies behind a piece of blank piece of paper held in a portrait position.

The fitness goal is to measure the same or narrower than the paper’s width – which is just 21cm or 8.27 inches.

*** Do YOU have an erotic collarbone? Bizarre new coin trend judges how good your figure is ***

Originating in China, hundreds of thousands of teens have posted selfies of their attempts on social media site Weibo, known as the Chinese Twitter.

Like many other viral challenges before this one, it tends to be young women who take part in a bid to show off their thin physiques.

Fans of the slim-waist challenge claim that it’s a reachable goal to aim towards and they’ve also shared photos of Chinese models who possess standard ""A4 waists"".

Most boys have shunned the trend and refused to take part as they say it’s impossible for them to have such a small waist.

*** Women are sticking vodka-soaked tampons up their vaginas – and the effects are shocking ***

But it’s sending a worrying message about body image that seems to be saying the thinner you are the better you are.

It’s also asking young women to measure up to random tests of beauty and could promote body shaming and eating disorders.

Previously there’s been a number of weird body trends that have sent the internet into meltdown including the “hold a Coke with your boobs” and the “belly button challenge” which had people wrapping their arms around their backs in a bid to touch their navels.

The idea behind it was that being able to touch your belly button from behind is supposedly an indicator of good health and being at an ideal weight.

But it was slated by many, who felt that it promoted body-shaming, while experts said it demonstrated flexibility rather than a slim figure.

Stranger yet, Chinese teens also started balancing rows of coins along their collarbones to flaunt their bone structure.

More recently the “underboob pen challenge” saw girls and boys sticking stationery under their tops to demonstrate that they could hold the object in place with their cleavage.

It also sparked a backlash trend where others balanced pennies between grooves in their stomachs.","boorish"

There are unconfirmed reports that the young child – thought to be just months old – was handed or thrown out of a window as the car careered into the water.

Two lifeboats from Lough Swilly and Greencastle, a helicopter from Sligo, gardai, ambulances, the fire brigade and local fishing boats were all involved in the rescue mission which lasted for several hours.

Army regiments are ready at a moment's notice to flood the capital's streets as back up for SAS and police amid fears the number of spots targeted at the same time will be in DOUBLE FIGURES.

Counter-terrorist bomb disposal teams are preparing to deal with explosives that could unleash poison gas or cancer causing radiation.

But most feared are weapons that could spread deadly and highly infectious viruses that could bring back nightmarish scenes last seen in London during the Great Plague – just over 450 years ago.

Meanwhile, the National Crime Agency has been ordered to launch a massive crackdown on illegal guns and arms dealers.

Airports and docks are being extra vigilant for weapon smugglers and terrorists entering with false passports.

A minister familiar with the proposal told The Sunday Times: ""We used to plan for three simultaneous attacks but Paris last November has shown you need to be ready for more than that.

""We are ready if someone tries with seven, eight, nine, ten.""

In recent weeks ISIS have been issuing a series of sinister threats to attack London and the UK.

This includes a chilling warning that Britain will suffer attacks so horrific they will ""turn children's hair white"".

Earlier this month top terror cop Mark Rowley warned ISIS are planning an ""enormous"" attack on Britain by its secret cells.

ISIS is believed to be stepping up plans to attack Britian following the RAF's intensification of bombing on its money-spinning oil installations in Syria.

In one of its hate manuals – tracked down by Daily Star Online – ISIS – also known as Daesh – a plot is revealed to recruit jihadis from an estimated 10,000 white converts in Britain – dubbing it as its ""strongest secret weapon"".

The terror group claim they are looking to ""white Muslims"" to avoid detection – compared to those from ethnic minorities ""who are easily exposed"".

They can be used either as spies or murderers.

Concerns are also growing that Islamic prisoners are also performing mock executions inside Britain’s most secure jails.

The last deadly terrorist attack on the capital was on July 7 in 2005 with suicide bombers targeting London’s transport system, killing 52 and injuring hundreds more.","dramatic"

At first glance, America’s largest airport is like any other with its giant terminal and massive car parks.

But it’s what’s inside that has got people spooked.

The airport was opened on February 28, 1995, after falling a year behind schedule and reportedly costing $2billion more than planned.

Since then barmy truth-seekers have barely left it alone and claim DIA is the symbol for the New World Order – a conspiracy theory referring to a total world government.

Daily Star Online investigates why people are getting so creeped out about it.

Ever since the first plane – a United Airlines flight to Kansas City – flew out of the airport, particular attention has been given to the outline of its runway.

There has been outrage over suggestions it resembles a swastika – the symbol now synonymous with evil after it was used by the Nazi party.

And you can see their point when viewed from above as the runways cover directions that seem to outline the symbol, despite planners having 34,000 acres to play with.

Other airports – such as Heathrow and JFK in New York – cover typically rigid long, straight directions.

Passengers heading to the airport are greeted with a statue of a giant horse on its hind legs.

The 32ft high stallion has been compared to the Pale horse of the Apocalypse, which carried a demonic figure that brought death, disease and hunger to the planet in the Bible.

It doesn’t appear to be the type of horse you’d like to pet – and its eyes light up red at night.

Creator Luis Jimenez even died in 2006 – when a large section of the sculpture fell on him.

The airport has various colourful murals painted by Leo Tanguma scattered around the building that seem pleasant enough on first glance.

But conspiracy theorists suggest their themes and artwork depict a bleak future for mankind.

The first, named Peace and Harmony with Nature, shows children with terrified looks on their faces as extinct plants and vegetation lie around them.

Huge flames engulfing a city takes up the background while another young child holds a Mayan tablet which some suggest depicts the end of the world.

Three open coffins of dead children take up the bottom of the painting.

The second piece – Children of the World Dream of Peace – features beaming kids holding national flags above what appears to be a soldier in a terrifying gas mask.

The second part of the painting featured the same sinister foot soldier holding both a machine gun and large scimitar – stabbing the white dove of peace – beside the ruins of a city.

A young child sleeps holding a teddy bear while a woman cries holding a limp child.

The same painting featured a letter in the bottom right hand corner written by Hama Herchenberg, 14, who was killed at Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943.

In an interview with Zing Zing Magazine, Tanguma said: “I have children sleeping amid the debris of war and this warmonger is killing the dove of peace, but the kids are dreaming of something better in the future and their little dream goes behind the general and continues behind this group of people, and the kids are dreaming that peace will happen someday.

“See how the little dream becomes something really beautiful, that someday the nations of the world will abandon war and come together.”

DIA was opened behind schedule and some claim this was to complete an underground labyrinth and tunnels for a new global government to launch should the world succumb to nuclear war or a devastating natural disaster.

It has been suggested it holds post-apocalyptic fallout shelters and FEMA concentration camps.

According to NY Mag, a whistle-blower working on the construction of the site allegedly revealed the project was delayed after five multi-storey buildings were built but then “buried” beneath the airport.

Spooky.

A stone found in the airport’s main terminal mentions the term New World Airport Commission – a slogan some fear is a nod towards the New World Order.

A time capsule is also mysteriously buried under the stone and should not be opened until 2094.

What could be in it?

Daily Star Online has contacted Denver International Airport for comment and received an extensive explanation for each theory.

A spokesman for the airport said: ""People have spoken and speculated about various conspiracy theories at DEN for a long time. We’ve heard the conspiracy stories since the airport opened in 1995.

""We have heard everything from the airport containing underground runways to concealing alien structures.

""People have questioned the murals, the time capsule and the underground tunnels.

""We have literally responded to hundreds of inquiries and all the information can be found in a variety of sources. Really, there is nothing controversial here at all. We don’t give credence to any of the thinking that goes behind these theories.

""The horse art is actually named 'Blue Mustang.'""

He added: ""Some people love the sculpture, and some people hate it. But that’s what art is supposed to do – create a public dialogue.

""Mustang has become an iconic part of the airport and Denver over the years. It was commissioned as permanent public art and installed near the airport entrance along the main access road.

""The murals are a very misunderstood piece of public art. There are actually two murals done by local artist Leo Tanguma entitled 'In Peace and Harmony With Nature' and 'The Children of the World Dream of Peace.'

""In the artist’s words, the murals portray humanity coming together to heal nature and live in peace.

""They do speak to the destruction of our environment and the impact that can have on the future of all species: animals and humans.""

He continued: ""The murals also portrays the destruction that greed and racism has had and can have on our population. In short, the intention of these murals is to open people’s eyes and it is the artist’s wish for the world to thrive in peace.

""The runways are not in the shape of a swastika. Our airfield has a highly efficient layout in both north-south and east-west configurations, which allow for takeoffs and landings no matter what direction the winds is blowing here.

""We have the ability to add 6 more runways, for a total of 12. That will dramatically change the aerial view of the airfield, someday.

""We have extensive underground tunnels that are used to transport luggage from aircraft to the terminal. No underground bases, unfortunately.""","dramatic"

Experts say the discoveries – found near the village of Słonowice – are triangular megalithic tombs varying in sizes made using huge stone blocks.

The incredible find comes after another valley of pyramids was discovered by Dr Sam Osmanagich in Bosnia, as reported by Daily Star Online.

Explorers have unearthed seven Polish pyramids so far - the highest being five metres – after using laser scanning technology.

The tombs’ inner chambers were constructed using wooden logs instead of stones and were hidden under earth in a forested area.

The tombs were built by the Funnel Beaker Culture community from the fifth to third millennium BC and those buried within them were elders of the tribe, according to arcghaelolosts.

Dr Krzysztof Tunia, from the Institute of Archeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, said: “The wooden-earthen pyramid complex on which we’re working is the largest of its kind in Europe.

“Where stones were scarce, as they were in the soil of Kazimierza Wielka region, chambers were constructed from wood.”

The structures – like the pyramids in Egypt – are heavily influenced by astronomy and are placed along the east-west line, with the entrance to the tomb’s chamber always on the east side.

The sites are visibly similar to prehistoric Stonehenge, which was built around the same period.

Polish pyramids have since been discovered in Dolic, where there are potential a dozen megalithic tombs, Kujawy and in the Skronie forest near Kołobrzeg.

Talking to Daily Star Online, Dr Osmanagich said the structures he found in Bosnia proves everything we’ve been told about ancient history is wrong.

He claims the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun stands are more than 220 metres – 73 metres taller than the Great Pyramid of Egypt.

And he says the structures are around 34,000 years old – making them the oldest on the planet.

Dr Osmanagich said: ""Almost everything they teach us about ancient history is wrong: origin of man, civilizations and pyramids.

""Our development is not linear but cyclical.

""Civilizations reach their peaks and global catastrophes wipe them out from the face of the planet. New beginning follows.

An electronic sex chip, dubbed the Orgasmatron, has been patented in the US by anesthesiologist and pain specialist Dr Stuart Meloy.

He stumbled upon the breakthrough during a routine pain-relief operation back in 2001.

*** This is what happens to your body during an orgasm ***

“We implant electrodes into the spine and use electrical pulses to modify the pain signals passing along the nerves,” he told New Scientist previously.

But during one operation he failed to hit the right spot and gave his patient a climax instead.

“I was placing the electrodes and suddenly the woman started exclaiming emphatically,” he continued. “I asked her what was up and she said: 'You’re going to have to teach my husband to do that.’”

Dr Stuart thought he could use his discovery to treat ladies with female orgasmic disorder – which affects up to 42% of women.

Despite thinking that women would be beating his door down to test out the pleasure-maker, he hasn’t been too successful in drumming up interest for people to take part in clinic trials so far.

A volunteer would have to be willing to have electrodes inserted in her spine and then have a pacemaker-size machine implanted under the skin to have the sexual release.

You might be wondering how a woman can feel like she’s orgasming from a switch in her spine but those who have test-driven the device said they felt as though their clitoris and vagina were actually being stimulated.

*** Women are paying strangers to stroke their vaginas in bizarre new sex craze ***

Speaking exclusively to Daily Star Online, sexpert and psychologist Dr Candice Nicole explained just how you can reach the big-O from a box in your back.

She said: “The spine houses the central nervous system, which connects the brain to the body and vice versa.

“Signals for both pain and pleasure travel the central nervous system. This device, depending on its placement, can be used to curb pain by modifying the pain signals or to induce pleasure by triggering the pleasure signals.

“The genitals have many nerves available for stimulation.”

But is an orgasm-inducing device a good, or necessary, idea?

Dr Candice said: ""There are levels to treatment one should consider before opting for a spinal implant.

""Sex therapy may include talking about the experiences, feelings, sensations, thoughts and relationship patterns that influence one's ability to experience an orgasm.

""For example, some women were able to orgasm with one partner but not with another.

""This may point to relationship dynamics or a need for sexual communication.

""Sex therapy may also include behavioural homework that clients can try outside of therapy.""

She continued: ""Using sex toys may be another non-surgical option to assist in reaching orgasm.

""These can be done with or without a partner.

""I often encourage clients to incorporate both, adding mindfulness exercises to help relax the body and reduce any physiological and mental blocks to orgasm.

""A device may be a last resort for people who have unsuccessfully tried other non-invasive approaches, however, there has been little research on the effectiveness of the device.

""It hasn't been able to get FDA approval because of lack of funding and volunteers.""

While it seems like a revolutionary gadget, Dr Candice didn’t think that the spine switch would become an affordable option for the masses.

She said: ""Women continue to contend with social and cultural norms that dictate what types of sexual experiences they should be having and those won't change with the introduction of an orgasm device to the market.

""Changing the way we holistically understand women's sexual health could include such a device, as one of many moving parts, but it is important to have all viable options available so that women can make informed choices.

""The downside of a device like this is that it isn't going to be financially available to most women, even if it did become FDA approved.""","vulgar"

In fact a recent study by the University of Kentucky which polled more than 14,000 people found that 45% of men want a longer schlong.

While some men resort to getting penis enlargement surgery or penoplasty in a bid to boost their confidence in the trouser department, it’s not the only option out there.

*** Legal prostitute debunks popular myths about penis size ***

Here are a number of natural remedies that claim to boost your penis size:

1. Ginkgo Bilbao pills

Would you pop a pill to get a bigger penis? One tablet you can swallow is gingko bilboa pills, a herbal remedy made from tree leaves, traditionally used in Chinese medicine to boost memory.

The idea is that ginkgo increases blood flow to the penis, so particularly men with poor circulation will feel like they’ve got a bigger trouser snake.

Although scientific evidence is not conclusive, researchers at the University of California found that Gingko is most effective in helping men suffering from sexual dysfunction as a side effect of using anti-depressants.

2. Zinc

Zinc is associated with increasing sperm count, testosterone levels and functioning of the prostate.

The mineral helps the body to heal and can speed up recovery time. Interestingly 5mg of zinc is disposed of when you ejaculate.

A study published in the Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences looked into the effects of zinc supplements on rats’ sexual behaviour.

Scientists found that it improved the rodents’ sexual competence by “increasing penile thrusting and prolonging ejaculatory latency without disturbing arousability and motivation”.

3. L-Arginine cream

This cream contains the amino acid L-arginine which makes blood vessels dilate giving the appearance of a bigger penis.

It does this by increasing the quantity of nitric oxide in the body, which widens the blood vessels and causes increased blood flow to the penis.

*** Best sex positions to help men last longer in bed naturally ***

4. Watermelon

Surprisingly watermelon has certain properties that may increase penis size and boost erections. The fruit contains an amino acid called citrulline, which gets converted into L-arginine by the kidneys.

It’s a pretty new discovery so no-one knows how much watermelon you have to scoff to get a longer schlong, but you can be sure not to get any bizarre side effects from eating watermelon – as long as you don’t have an allergy.

But do these non-surgical options work?

Speaking exclusively to Dailystar.co.uk, certified plastic surgeon Dr David Alessi revealed that these natural penis primping procedures might not actually be very effective.

He said: “Suction devices, pills like gingko and creams have been studied and there is no evidence that any work.”

Dr David also revealed that a new cosmetic trend is seeing men opt for surgery to increase their girth down below.

*** Can you guess how big the average vagina really is? ***

Explaining the procedure, he said: “Fat injections to increase girth involve taking fat from the belly and injecting it deeply into the penis.”

The medic, who founded the Alessi Institutes and Face Forward, a charity offering free procedures for victims of domestic abuse, warned that lads’ obsession with penis size could be a symptom of a serious psychological problem.

He said: “Most men who think they have a small penis actually don’t. Studies vary, but research suggests that the average erect penis ranges from under five inches to just under six inches.

“Most men who think their penis is too small have penis dysmorphic syndrome and would be better off seeing a shrink and not a surgeon.”","vulgar"

But did you know that every part of your body is affected when you reach climax.

Here’s a breakdown of how the different areas react when you peak:

*** What REALLY happens to your body during sex in 5 simple steps ***

Eyes

When you reach the big-O your pupils dilate, increasing in diameter by nearly 50%.

If you’re a person who gets turned on by visual things, it’s also possible that your sight will improve while in the throes of passion.

Nose

As your breathing gets heavier during an orgasm, your sense of smell improves.

Research based on animals revealed this is so you can sniff your partner’s pheromones better – the chemicals that are linked to sexual attraction and excitement.

Mouth

Most people will produce more saliva during climax due to the parasympathetic nervous system. However some people – particularly men – will get a drier mouth if they’re feeling anxious about the act.

Skin

Having an orgasm makes you feel hot as both body temperature and metabolism rise.

Also, the parts of your brain which control pain and orgasm overlap, so when you’re actually half as sensitive to pain when you’re climaxing.

Chest

Both men and women experience sensitive nipples as the nerve endings open up and your upper body becomes flushed.

For ladies, breasts become engorged and they increase in size the hormone prolactin is released.

Heart

Blood pressure goes up and your heart race soars to over 100 beats per minute.

*** This is what happens to your penis after you take Viagra ***

Pelvis

For men, the muscles in their lower body will tense up as they experience ejaculation.

Muscles at the base of the penis will contract between 10 and 14 times in the space of the same amount of seconds and guy’s legs will often shake.

While guys’ genitals are tightening, a woman’s pelvis relaxes and the vagina elongates to allow the penis to enter further.

During climax muscles in the vagina contract seven to eight times

Both male and female genitals swell as blood flow increases to the pelvic area and skin becomes more sensitive as nerve endings rise to the surface of the skin.","vulgar"

According to a new study published in The Journal of Sex Research nearly half of us have deviant sexual fantasies.

What’s more, a third of people have acted on their desire at least once. The research surveyed 1,040 Canadians and revealed that sexual tastes which are considered abnormal by psychiatrists are actually a lot more normal than you might think.

*** From eyeball licking to kinky vomiting: 13 strange and disturbing sexual fetishes revealed ***

Out of the eight “paraphilic” fetishes listed – voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism, masochism, sadism, fetishism and transvestism – four of them were found to be surprisingly common desires.

Christian Joyal, who led the study, explained: “Some paraphilic interests are more common than people might think, not only in terms of fantasies but also in terms of desire and behaviour.

“The main goal of the study was to determine normal sexual desires and experiences in a representative sample of the general population.”

The most popular fantasy was voyeurism, which is when you get a kick out of spying on others having sex, with 35% of the men and women in the study confessing they liked it.

More than a quarter (26%) admitted they were into fetishism, being sexually attracted to objects and another 26% liked frotteurism, which involves rubbing your genitals against a non-consenting person.

And almost a fifth (19%) got a kinky pleasure from being in pain – also known as masochism.

Christian continued: ”Overall, nearly half (45.6%) of the sample subjects were interested in at least one type of sexual behaviour that is considered anomalous, whereas one third (33%) had experienced the behaviour at least once.

“These facts suggest that we need to know what normal sexual practices are before we label a legal sexual interest as anomalous.”

The study also revealed that men tend to have more kinky fantasies than women but both had an equal interest in fetishism and masochism.

Interestingly the masochists and those interested in being submissive, reckoned they had the best sex lives.

Christian said: ”In general, it is true that men are more interested in paraphilic behaviours than women.

“However, this doesn't mean that women don't have these interests at all.

“In fact, women who report an interest in sexual submission have more varied sexual interests and report greater satisfaction with their sex lives. Sexual submission is therefore not an abnormal interest.”","vulgar"

Genital beading involves inserting a small ball, often made of plastic or metal, beneath the skin of the penis via a small incision.

It apparently makes women “go mad with pleasure” because it stimulates the clitoris, but this could be a myth as the pearl is usually placed at the tip of the penis while it should be placed at the base to really stimulate the area.

*** Men are taking anti-depressants to last longer in bed – and the effects are shocking ***

The procedure, also known as pearling, is a form of body modification similar to inserting a subdermal implant, but alarmingly the surgery is usually performed at-home and without proper hygiene precautions.

The bizarre sex trend is becoming increasingly prevalent in Cuba, according to Vice Spain, as well as Australia and the Philippines.

It’s most common among young men in the military, sailors and convicts. And while nowadays men are choosing to insert the pearls for sexual satisfaction, the craze is said to have originated in Asia with Yakuza members performing pearling during their stints in prison.

The Japanese mafia apparently inserted one bead each year to symbolise the time spent behind bars.

Doctors warn that the procedure can cause tetanus, banality or gangrene – which in serious cases could lead to the penis being amputated.

Speaking exclusively to Daily Star Online, Dr Candice Nicole explained: “Although pearling is typically safe when a piercing professional inserts the beads, the health risks of genital beading can include infections, erectile dysfunction, bodily rejection of the pearl, scarring and pain.

“For those done at home, the health risks increase exponentially, because the person is often untrained about the anatomy of a penis, how deep to make the incisions, what types of tools to use and how to sanitise them properly.

“This increases the risk infection and injury substantially.”

*** Would you have this bizarre procedure to boost your penis size? ***

Although it is possible that the pearling can enhance sex for both men and women.

Dr Natalie Atere-Roberts, GP for medical helpline Dr Morton’s, told Daily Star Online: ""Enhancing sensation during intercourse is one of the reasons many men have the procedure done.

""In the same way that ribbed condoms work, having beads under the skin of the penis can lead to added stimulation for both the male and female partner, helping them to achieve orgasm and perhaps make them more intense.""

But the procedure does come with glaring medical risks and there’s also the possibility that your partner won’t enjoy the sensation of the pearl in the same way that some people don’t like the feel of ribbed condoms or sex toys.

Dr Candice added: “It depends on the woman.

“There are women who like pearled penises and women who find them anything from uncomfortable and unattractive to painful.

“The same way some women like dildos with beads and some women do not, pearls aren't for all girls.

“If a woman does enjoy pearled penises, they may be able to increase the chances of or enhance orgasm depending on where the pearls are placed and where the woman experiences the most vaginal pleasure.”

Pearling isn’t the only potentially harmful way that men are trying to boost their sexual performance, some are also illegally obtaining testosterone gel and smearing it on their testicles.

On Reddit forums, men openly discuss their experiences of illegally taking testosterone and how it has increased the quality of their erections.

It’s typically being used by guys who are interested in bodybuilding and taken in conjunction with other illegal anabolic steroids.","vulgar"

We already announced the kinky suction sex toy that performs oral sex on a woman, but now this brand new device will let men experience the much-desired sensation without needing a partner.

Featuring 10 oscillating “turbo tongues” which rotate at three different speeds, the sex toy simulates intense oral sex action with a variety of pulsating patterns.

*** You can now switch your sperm off before sex ***

The gadget’s maker Lovehoney, Britain's biggest online sex toy retailer, said that the waterproof device offers men the “ultimate joy” on tap – and it’s so small you can carry it in your pocket.

Co-owner Neal Slateford said: ""Now men don't have to wait for their birthday for great oral sex.""

The makers of the rechargeable device are hailing 2016 as the “year of the male sex toy” after seeing a 20% increase in sales of products aimed at men.

The Sqweel XT is based on the original female oral sex toy Sqweel, which was launched in 2011 and uses the same powerful rotating tongue design.

Neal said: ""After the success of the Sqweel it was the obvious next step to create a similar toy for men.

""The momentum for male sex toys is gathering pace and we're seeing huge demand.

""The Sqweel XT is revolutionising the way men enjoy sex.

""The sex toy market has always been dominated by women's toys and it's only very recently that men have begun to discover what they've been missing out on.""

She says: “I wanted to write a blog saying that women like sex too.

“It’s not unusual for women to be into kinky experiences just as much as men.

“I didn’t expect it to become massive – I expected it just to be a small circle of my followers sharing dirty stories.”

Known only as Sarah, she set up the blog in 2011 and now has 120,000 visitors every month. She first got into kinky sex with a former boyfriend while at university.

The pair visited fetish clubs, spanking parties and swingers’ clubs and had threesomes before deciding to write about their experiences online. But when her boyfriend got cold feet over unveiling the details of their sex life to the world, Sarah decided to go it alone.

She says: “I’d always been super interested in sex ever since I discovered boys, I thought it was brilliant But I first started getting into the kinky stuff at university with my first significant boyfriend.

“We started off doing spanking around the house with wooden spoons or books – we were at uni so had these massive big coursework books to use.

“Then we went to our first fetish club when we were 18. I was terrified. It was really fun though.

“I didn’t even know places like that existed, then you walk into a room and there’s a naked woman being whipped and a crowd of people standing around watching.

“We did more fetish clubs and did different things with different people. We’d go to fetish clubs, to school spanking parties where everyone went in school uniform and got caned by the headmaster.

“What we were looking for was the newness – we always wanted to try something new, a swingers’ club then a threesome.”

After they split, Sarah dated and had sex with lots of different people and was certain she didn’t want love, romance or to settle down.

“Most of the people I met were quite kinky people, or they would be guys that I would meet up and sh** in town,” she says.

Even when she got together with current boyfriend Mark five years ago, Sarah was still seeing different men. But the first time Mark went with someone else, she realised she wanted more commitment.

Sarah, 31, struggled to juggle writing her sex blog and being in a relationship. She says: “For a long time we were casually dating and I was seeing other people and writing the sex blog – I couldn’t really have a boyfriend for that.

""Initially Mark was delighted about the blog and interested in learning more about the kind of things that turned me on.

“The fact I’ve slept with lots of people doesn’t bother him.

“We spend all of our time together laughing and sh***ing and I can’t complain about that.”

Nowadays, Sarah is less likely to visit a fetish club or sex party, but still has a very active sex life.

She says: “Mark and I play – we will invite one or two people we like to come round our house and chill and sometimes we have sex.

“We’ve recently started experimenting with virtual-reality porn.

We’ve got a Google Cardboard thing and downloaded this virtual-reality porn.

“He watched it as if he was the man and I pleasured him as it was playing.

“Then we swapped round so I watched it as a man to see what it’s like from that point of view.

“The one thing I’ve never done that’s top of my list is a gang bang with loads of blokes. I’ve never been able to arrange it. How many friends do I have who would do it? Because I wouldn’t want it to be strangers.”

Sarah added: “One day I will manage to do it with five, maybe six dudes. Maybe six is a bit greedy!”

Girl On The Net has seen a huge change in attitudes to sex since she started writing the blog, and reckons the internet has helped people realise that their fantasies are perfectly normal.

“The internet is amazing because it gives you that ‘me too’ feeling,” she says.

“I’d have all these fantasies of getting beaten up, getting whipped and I thought I was weird, that there was something wrong with me.

“And now you can just Google it and go: ‘Oh wait, I’m fine. There are loads of other people like me’.

“And also what’s helped is that sex toys have always been marketed towards women and now we’re getting the interesting opposite where people are making sex toys for men. Men can use them too.

“And I know people slag off Fifty Shades Of Grey but it had loads of women reading it and saying, ‘This turned me on’.

“I think that’s a brilliant thing because for a long time we didn’t expect to be open about what turned us on.”

Sarah also thinks we will see a new wave of erotica in the next few years, with porn aimed at women. And now she’s quit her day job to write about sex full-time, she doesn’t have any intention of slowing down.

“I don’t make as much as I did when I had a full-time job, but I have a full income writing about sex,” she says.

“And it’s what I’ve always wanted to do.

“They say write what you love and I really love sh***ing and everything involved with it.

“I’d like to do more exploring with new things – new sex toys, new sex tech, watching virtual-reality porn being filmed.”

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/499943/Men-erection-penis-sex-life-quit-smoking-effects-cigarettes-tobacco-nicotine","Giving up this one thing can boost your sex life and improve erections","If you’re hooked on cigarettes, it could be seriously damaging your sex life without you knowing.

The health risks of smoking are particularly shocking when it comes to men because fags can restrict blood flow to the penis making it more difficult to get an erection.

According to sexual health and wellbeing expert Samantha Evans, co-owner of online sex toy retailer Jo Divine, the addiction can even lead to penis problems like erectile dysfunction and impotence.

*** Would you have this bizarre procedure to boost your penis size? ***

Samantha said: “Smoking damages blood vessels by increasing the build-up of plaque in the arteries which hinders the blood flow, creating an array of circulatory problems throughout the body, including the penis.""

A 2003 study, which surveyed more than 4,700 men with an average age of 47, found that those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day had a 60% higher risk of erectile dysfunction compared to men who had never puffed.

More recently research published in the British Journal of Urology International found that nicotine had a particular impact on sexual function.

Men who quit enjoyed “thicker, more rigid erections” and could get it up five times quicker than lads who relapsed into their tobacco habit.

Samantha explained: “Nicotine can cause erectile dysfunction as it is a vasoconstrictor, which narrows the blood vessels, thus reducing blood flow.”

The research shows how cigarettes can impact a man’s sex life physically, but smoking can also diminish sexual desire and appetite – even for men as young as 20.

*** Men are smearing this gel on their testicles to boost erections ***

Scientists found that smokers said they had sex less than six times a month, while non-smokers were enjoying romps nearly twice as often.

When it comes to the ladies, there hasn’t been much research into the link between smoking and sexual arousal but it’s likely that nicotine affects women in the same way because both male and female genitals swell with blood when the person feels turned on.

So if the drug can restrict blood flow and cause erectile dysfunction in men it’s possible that smoking could affect women’s arousal and sexual sensation.

*** This everyday item is killing your sperm ***

But if you can quit that one unhealthy habit, you can expect to see a range of health benefits that won't just stop at the bedroom.

Samantha said: “If you need a reason to quit smoking, look no further than increasing your sex appeal and sexual performance.

“Giving up will not only improve your overall health by decreasing your risk of cancer and heart disease and save you money, but will also boost your sex appeal and add a spark to your sex life.”","vulgar"

Orgasmic meditation (OM) practitioners are holding group masturbation classes to teach women how to climax, promising that the lessons can lead to a “larger state of consciousness, improving intimacy in relationships and generally increasing your orgasm skills”.

During a typical orgasmic meditation class, the woman undresses from the waist down while a total stranger strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.

*** This is how men can have multiple orgasms and last longer in bed ***

But before the fully-clothed stroker starts to massage their partner’s downstairs with the help of organic lube, they describe the vagina they are looking at, going into detail about the colour, texture and shape.

OM participants do the stroking in front of other group members in what’s called a “nest”.

While the session might sound rather sexual there’s apparently “no goal other than to feel, connect and be present”.

It may sound like a bizarre and seedy sex cult, but it’s popularity has been snowballing since it was founded in 2001.

There’s over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 already in the UK, attracting a mixed clientele – anything from couples in their early 20s to people in their 80s.

The craze was founded by 46-year-old academic Nicole Daedone and her San Francisco-based organisation OneTaste but has been spreading across the globe with workshops, conferences and lectures.

In her TED talk, which has had more than 1.2million views, Nicole explained: ""The female orgasm is vital for every single woman on the planet.""

This type of sexual awakening doesn’t come free though – it costs £147 per session.

*** What happens to a woman's vagina if she doesn't reach orgasm will shock you ***

Joanna Van Vleck, a OneTaste employee, thinks that climaxing will become the new morning coffee.

She said: “Most women are ‘tired and wired’ and OM is the exact opposite of that.

“It’s like eating breakfast. That’s what we eventually hope: Instead of a latte, women will have an OM.

""Because that’s what regulates your body. An orgasm for breakfast, you know?”","vulgar"

The prehistoric pooch was found near evidence of human activity – leading researchers to believe it was a caveman's pet.

Staggeringly, the fossil flea-bag was found with its fur, teeth and much of its brain intact.

Experts have thawed out the mummified mongrel – and a controversial Korean cloning guru is now hoping to bring the species back from the dead.

South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk – who is infamous for his ambition to clone woolly mammoths – was present at an autopsy on the dino dog.

He took away skin, muscle and ear cartilage samples – with a view to cloning the canine.

Sergey Fedorov, research fellow at Russia's North-Eastern Federal University, said: ""He was satisfied with the degree of preservation.

""He was very excited.""

Woo-Suk – who also plans to clone an extinct cave lion – is building an animal cloning facility in China and has held a dog-cloning competition in the United Kingdom.

A British couple forked out £134,000 to clone their beloved dead dog at a South Korean lab.

The cavedog was found in the bank of the River Syalakh, in the Russian Federation's barren Sakha Republic.

Docs had to wash off mud and dirt built up over a dozen millennia before carrying out an autopsy in capital Yakutsk.

Dr Pavel Nikolsky – research fellow of the Geological Institute, Moscow – said: ""The carcass is preserved really very well.

""And one of the most important things is that the brain is preserved.

""The degree of preservation is about 70 to 80 per cent.""

And when the owner cut open her stomach he was dumbfounded to find the two-headed calf looking up at him.

The unusual calf has two heads, two noses, two sets of eyes and two mouths.

Villagers say they have never seen anything like it and cannot begin to explain how it happened.

But local media has speculated that it could be the result of poor nutrition or genetically modified foods.

The birth follows that of another two-headed calf born in Peru last year.

In August 2015, villagers in the remote north-western village of Vista Alegre were left divided over the birth of the animal, with some seeing it as bringing good luck, and others saying it was a bad omen.

He managed to take a snap of the aerial object as it hovered for a few minutes before suddenly vanishing in front of his eyes.

The 65-year-old from Dysart is convinced he saw an extra-terrestrial aircraft above him around Rossie Ochil to the south of Perth.

He said: “It’s definitely a space craft of some sort.

“I don’t know whether I frightened it or not with the flash of the camera, because in the beat of a heart it was gone.”

It happened at around 11pm on Sunday February 28, when he was driving home after visiting a friend.

He described how the noise drowned out the sound of his jeep.

He said: “My jeep is quite noisy, but this sounded like a thousand hoovers.

“When I phoned my friend, who’s a shepherd, he said ‘don’t worry about it, we get this up here quite a lot’.

“I always thought there was something out there, but have never seen anything until now.

“There is no doubt in my mind. I know what I saw.”

John estimates he was 50 to 70 yards from the object when he took his picture.

One suggestion is that the mysterious flying object ,which looks like the spacecraft in the Stephen Spielberg’s science fiction hit movie, could have been a drone.

But the Civil Aviation Authority said although it was possible to fly a drone in darkness it would make managing to control such a craft much more difficult.

A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: “It’s possible to fly a drone in darkness, but you have to keep it in your line of sight at all times.

“If you are flying something in darkness it is difficult to keep it in your visual line of sight.

“Even though it has lights, you won’t be able to see it sufficiently well to control it.

“At night, you can’t see obstacles because the obstacles aren’t lit.”

But John dismisses the idea that his experience was anything other than out of this world.

Drone pilot, Jonathan Hall, from Southport says he is also convinced that the image is not a drone.

This isn’t the first time WhatsApp has favoured one handset type over another.

Android owners, who have had their own early access offerings, were only last month introduced to more than 100 new emoji that iPhone users had been utilising for months.

The timing of WhatsApp’s latest move is an unusual one, with the company having confirmed that it will cease support for all Windows 7 devices by June 30 of this year.

The company made the announcement late last year, stating: ""we will be ending support for WhatsApp Messenger on some mobile platforms.

""While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don't offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.

""This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.""","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/592976/iPhone-8-release-date-USB-C-connection-hated-feature","iPhone 8 release date - This major new feature could be the iPhone’s most hated addition","The world’s largest annual phone show, Mobile World Congress, is over for another year, and so attention turns instead to the iPhone 8.

With most of the year’s major Android phone’s having now dropped - we’re still waiting on the Samsung Galaxy S8 - the iPhone 8 remains the final big unknown of 2017 smartphones.

According to latest reports, however, the eagerly awaited Apple handset could play host to a major new feature that will ruffle a few feathers.

That’s because it’s expected the handset will see Apple ditch its it’s traditional Lightning connection in favour of something brand new.

With connection changes always hitting Apple fans hardest, such a move would see all of your iPhone-friendly Lightning connection accessories such as docks, speakers and charging stations become redundant overnight.

What’s more, with last year’s 3.5mm headphone jack bereft iPhone 7 having forced many into splashing out on new Lightning headphones, it could pose further trouble for those who enjoy annual upgrades.

Those wanting an iPhone 8 with their existing equipment then would need to buy a number of costly adaptors.

Apple has used the Lightning connector on all of its iPhone and iPad devices since 2012 when the iPhone 5 hailed the arrival of the new connector.

Previously to that, iPhones had hosted the same 30-pin connector as the iPod line-up.

Although a contentious move at the time, the Lighting connection has become widely adopted, although highlighting the potential issues of another step change, 30-pin ports can still be seen gathering dust on older gym equipment and hotel speakers.

With the Lightning port reportedly on the chopping block, reports for the often reliable Wall Street Journal have claimed the iPhone 8 will instead play host to a USB Type C connection port.

Already a mainstay in the Android community, a USB C iPhone would see Apple usually fall in line with the rest of the industry.

This wouldn’t be the Cupertino company’s first foray into the realms of USB C, however, with the connection port already in place on the company’s current MacBook Pro line.

As well as a more universal connection allowing cross-device accessories, a USB C based move would allow Apple to introduce new quick charge features to future iPhones.

Although Apple has yet to comment on the claims, it’s been suggested the new connection when the iPhone 8 is released this September.

Changing power port aside, past reports have suggested the handset will adopt an all new form factor, with a larger, sharper screen to be introduced alongside a glass back, inbuilt wireless charging options and improved cameras.","geeky"

The Galaxy S8 will be unveiled at a major Unpacked event on March 29 and it's set to reveal one of the best phones the world has ever seen.

If rumours are true, the new S8 will come in two sizes with the standard phone featuring a 5.8-inch screen and the bigger Plus model landing in your pocket with a giant 6.2-inch display.

Both with include stunning AMOLED technology and will curve and cover the entire front of the device.

Along with this all-new display we're also expecting to see an updated camera and incredibly fast processor from Qualcomm called the Snapdragon 835.

The S8 and S8 Plus will no doubt be waterproof and include a rear fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone.

Finally, it's thought the new devices will include Samsung's new personal assistant called Bixby.

The excitement around these new smartphones is growing rapidly and now two major leaks will have Samsung fans in even more of a frenzy.

Two images have appeared online claiming to show exactly what the S8 will look like.

The official looking renders clearly reveal the giant screen with one claiming it will be called an Infinity display.

We'll know more about these devices later this month when Samsung reveals all on March 29.

If you can't wait that long Samsung has just revealed its new lineup of portable computers which look seriously impressive.

The Korean tech giant lifted the lid on their all-new tech slates at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona with both Windows and Android-powered devices on show.

For Windows 10 fans Samsung is launching its Galaxy Book which includes a clever keyboard and S Pen in the box - rival Windows tablets usually charge for these extras.

The Galaxy Book is launching in two sizes with 10.6-inch and 12-inch versions both going on sale soon.

If Windows 10 isn't your thing, Samsung has also launched an Android-powered tablet called and Tab S3.

The Galaxy Tab S3 comes with a 9.7-inch Super AMOLED display which can also play videos in stunning HDR quality.

It features a new glass and metal design and quad-stereo speakers tuned by AKG by HARMAN for premium visual and listening experiences.

The retro device, which first launched back in 2000, has had a complete overhaul and will land in hands later this year.

With a new look, bigger colour screen and rear camera it's sure to be one of the biggest tech hits of the year.

This latest 3310 also includes a refreshed version of the Snake game and there's a whopping month-long battery life.

The Nokia 3310 will be available in either Warm Red and Yellow, both with a high-gloss finish, and Dark Blue and Grey, with a matte-look finish.

Carphone Warehouse in the UK has an exclusive deal to sell the 3310 and will be releasing more details on price soon.

Nokia says the phone will cost €49 but there's currently no official confirmation on UK pricing.

So, all looks bright for Nokia but before you rush out to buy one there could be some competition coming its way.

Motorola, which is now owned by Chinese firm Lenovo, could be planning to relaunch the famous Razr.

The first Razr was released in 2004 and it's striking clamshell designed helped it to become a huge success.

In fact, the phone went on to sell over 130 million units worldwide and it is still the most popular device of its type ever made.

Now fans of this phone might get the chance to own it again.

Speaking to American news site CNBC, Yuanqing Yang, CEO of Lenovo, revealed: ""We should be smart if Motorola fans remember something. If Razr is a good one we should think about how to leverage that.

""But whatever we bring back, it has to be a stronger product than the original.

""We are aiming to turn around this business, we must be a healthy business.""

Lenovo's smartphone business has been losing money in recent years and a relaunch of the Razr could help to turn things around.

The company has just unveiled two new devices at MWC with the Moto G5 and G5 Plus both launching soon.

The Moto G series continues to Lenovo’s mid-range Moto devices.

The company is framing the device launch as closely in line with consumer preferences for the price point. Lenovo is focusing on hardware design, battery life and camera capabilities with the Moto G5.

The new Moto devices will be available in various markets in March, starting at €199 for the Moto G5 and €229 for the Moto G5 Plus.","geeky"

The Finnish phone company revealed its brand-new Nokia 3310 at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and its launch has taken the show by storm.

The new Nokia 3310 includes an updated design, which makes it lighter and more durable, plus there’s a bigger screen to view your content which, unlike its predecessor, is now in full colour.

A 2-megapixel rear camera has also been included and a new version of the classic Sake game is pre-loaded on the device.

If you’re worried about battery life, don’t be as the new Nokia 3310 can last for an entire month on one charge.

When it launches later this year it’s expected to cost around £50 and will ship in a number of different colours including grey, red and yellow.

Carphone Warehouse have already launched their pre-order website which can be found here.

The new Nokia 3310 is sure to be a massive hit but, before to get too excited about this retro phone, there is something missing.

The 3310 has no access to many popular apps including WhatsApp.

WhatsApp now has over one billion users who, on average, send 42 billion messages every day.

So, if you happen to buy a 3310 you won’t be able to join your usual chats and send endless messages to your mates.

Nokia has said there will be support for some apps including Twitter but Facebook is also out of bounds for 3310 adopters.

Daily Star Online has been lucky enough to have had an exclusive look at the 3310 and, despite the lack of WhatsApp support, retro phone fans are certainly in for a teat.

Nokia weren't the only company to launch new devices at MWC.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/592657/Xbox-Game-Pass-price-features-Xbox-One-Xbox-360","Xbox Game Pass price and features - Unlimited access to 100 top games on your console","The Xbox Game Pass will be offering top titles including Halo 5, Mad Max, Saints Row 4, Fable 3 and Gears of War to kick-off its service.

The service includes both Xbox One games and Xbox 360 titles thanks to Backwards Compatibility.

It begins rolling out to select members of the Xbox Insider Program at 2pm GMT today, and will launch to the broader community later this spring.

If you’re part of the Xbox Insider Program and would like to take the update right away, you’ll need to reboot your Xbox One; otherwise, Xbox Game Pass should appear on your dashboard ""within an hour or so"", say bosses.

Phil Spencer, of Xbox, said: ""At Xbox, we put gamers at the center of everything we do and remain committed to giving you the freedom to play the games you want, with the friends you want, on the devices you want.

""This year is shaping up to be an exciting one for gamers.

""As we prepare to launch Project Scorpio this holiday, bringing the most powerful console ever made to the Xbox One family of devices, we continue to make platform improvements to connect the growing community of players on Xbox Live and add to a robust and diverse portfolio of games across Xbox One and Windows 10.

""Today, we’re continuing our commitment to give you more options to diversify and expand your library of games with Xbox Game Pass, a new gaming subscription service coming later this spring.

""Xbox Game Pass gives you unlimited access to over 100 Xbox One and backward compatible Xbox 360 games – all for £7.99 per month.

""With great games from top industry publishers such as 2K, 505 Games, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment, Capcom, Codemasters, Deep Silver, Focus Home Interactive, SEGA, SNK CORPORATION, THQ Nordic GmbH, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Microsoft Studios, there’s something for everyone to enjoy and you will always find something exciting to play across a variety of genres.

""Some of the fan-favorite titles coming to Xbox Game Pass when it launches to the broader Xbox community later this spring include Halo 5: Guardians, Payday 2, NBA 2K16 and SoulCalibur II.""

As is common with new features and programs going into preview, Xbox Game Pass will be an early build with some feature limitations and will not be on par with the final experience that will be available later this spring.

Most notable for users in the Xbox Insider Program will be a limited catalogue - roughly 20 titles in Preview - and potentially some slight tweaks to the user interface.

Most AAA titles in the Xbox Game Pass catalogue will begin appearing when the program launches to the broader Xbox community later this spring.

You can expect to run into bugs while in the Xbox Insider Program. Note that the main focus of Preview is to test features and report bugs so the team can refine the experience before it launches broadly.

Xbox Game Pass will initially launch to the Xbox Insider Program without full localisation, meaning the product description and channel names will appear in English.

When the program launches to the broader Xbox community later this spring, the product description and channel names will be localised by country appropriately.
Mr Spencer added: ""It’s important to us that Xbox Game Pass provides an enjoyable and seamless experience.

""Before the program rolls out to the broader community later this spring, we’ll be testing Xbox Game Pass with select members of the Xbox Insider Program in the Alpha Preview ring starting today with a very limited number of titles.

""The titles that are available in Preview are just a small glimpse at the expansive catalog of games that will be available when Xbox Game Pass launches this spring.

""Xbox Live Gold members will also be receiving exclusive access to Xbox Game Pass prior to the program launching to the broader community. We’ll have more details on timing closer to launch.""","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/592356/Google-Chrome-update-web-browser-MacBook-Pro-Touch-Bar","Use Google Chrome? Major update will bring this awesome new feature to your browser","There's good news for anyone who loves browsing the web on Google Chrome.

The world's most popular browser looks set to get a major update and it could make it even more appealing to its army of fans.

A test version of Google Chrome has been spotted in the wild which appears to show Google is working on an update for Apple's MacBook users.

This upgraded software will bring support for Apple's clever Touch Bar which now comes included on the latest MacBook Pro laptops.

Apple launched its new MacBook Pro late last year with this laptop including the Touch Bar display which runs across the top of the keyboard.

Because the bar is actually a clever Retina display it’s able to change its appearance depending on what applications you’re using on the screen.

For example, draft a message in Mail and you’ll get the option to send it to the recipient with a quick tap on the bar.

Write a letter in Pages and you’ll get instant access to formatting options - or switch to Messages and you’ll get every emoji you could ever wish for just one tap away.

However, Google's Chrome currently doesn't support the Touch Bar meaning the screen goes blank when using the software.

The update should mean, in the future, MacBook Pro users will get a range of extra features appear in the bar.

Apple's Safari browser, which already includes Touch Bar support, allows users to get fast access to the web search tool, favourites and the ability to instantly switch between open web pages.

It's currently unclear when the Chrome update will be available for the Mac Book Pro but, with it already being tested, users could see it arrive soon.

The news of this update comes just days after Chrome users we warned of a new security threat.

The Google Chrome scam poses a serious risk to users with criminals able to inject infected script into poorly-protected web pages.

According to cyber experts the virus-filled script rewrites the compromised website on the victim’s browser.

This makes the page unreadable, with a fake pop-up then used to try and convince users into downloading a patch to solve the issue.

The popup reads, “The ‘HoeflerText’ font wasn’t found,” - and, if you see this warning, DON'T download the suggested update.

It's thought the problem is currently affecting Chrome users on Windows-powered machines.","geeky"

Powering the 12-inch Samsung Galaxy Book is a 7th Generation Intel Core i5 processor, Dual Core 3.1GHz whilst the 10.6-inch model gets Intel Core m3 processor, Dual core 2.6GHz brains.

There's also a decent 13 megapixel camera, expandable memory, over 10 hours of usage on one charge and this 2-in-1 is the thinnest in its class.

Following the LG G6 and BlackBerry KEYone into the realms of reality is this phone that looks like a classic Apple gadget.

With a sleek metal body that features softly rounded edges and comes in a variety of vibrant colours, the Huawei P10 is possibly the best looking phone at this year’s show.

Playing host to a 5.1-inch Full HD display, the slimline handset keeps its overall footprint down by using a heavily reduced bezel that allows the screen to run almost to the very edge of the device.

Coming in eight different colours, Huawei has paired traditional silver, white and black models, with two gold and a rose gold colour scheme.

It’s the unusual but beautiful blue and green handset options that really steal the how, however, bringing to mind the iconic iPod Touch.

Despite its stunning good looks, the Huawei P10 is more than a piece of high-tech eye candy. The phone also plays host to a flagship array of specs.

Powered by Huawei’s own Kirin 960 chipset, the phone is backed up by 4GB of RAM and a massive 64GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD.

There’s also a sizeable 3200mAh battery squeezed in to the phone’s compact form, with the handset to run Google’s latest Android 7.0 Nougat OS, skinned with Huawei’s EMUI interface, direct from the box.

On the camera front, the Huawei P10’s got plenty of them, with not one, but two fitted to the rear of the device.

Designed in parter with camera specialist Leica, one of the dual 12-megapixel cameras focusses on colour, while the other handles black and white shots.

When combined, they’re capable of capturing deeper, more impactful images, with a number of new software enhancements also allowing for 3D face mapping and an eye-catching, depth effect-adding Portrait mode.

Lining up alongside a larger sibling, the 5.5-inch Huawei P10 Plus, the new phone has yet to be handed a UK release date or price.

Far from Huawei’s only big announcement at the global tech show, the Chinese firm also unveiled a pair of new Apple Watch rivalling wearable devices in the form of the Huawei Watch 2 and Huawei Watch 2 Classic.

The 71-year-old thought she was just getting fat with old age but she was actually carrying a 10-stone tumour in her stomach.

She tipped the scales at more than 25 stone but when doctors examined her they made the shocking discovery.

Mary – from Pennsylvania, US – is now half the woman she used to be after having the 10-stone cyst surgically removed.

“I was so shocked when they told me. The first thing I thought was Sigourney Weaver in Alien,” she told WNEP.

“I was so scared. I exercised and did all sorts of things and I just kept getting rounder.""

The 22-year-old from Los Angeles, US, has spent a whopping $50,000 (£40,000) on his extreme look.

The make-up artist believes he's neither male nor female and he wants his appearance to mirror how he feels inside.

Now he plans to fork out another $160,000 (£130,000) on drastic surgery to have his genitalia, nipples and bellybutton removed.

Vinny said: ""I want to be a sexless alien being, I want my outside to reflect how I feel on the inside.

""The overall image I want to do is an alien. I want to be a hybrid, not male or female.

""I've wanted to be sexless and genderless, since I was 17, I've been going to doctors to see if it's possible but had no luck.

""I don't want people to think I'm trying to change into a woman. I could live without sexual organs so why should I have a penis or a vagina.

""I don't see why I shouldn't have my genitals completely removed and have nothing down there.""

Vinny started experimenting with cosmetic procedures when he was just 17 by getting lip fillers before going on to have two nose jobs and more.

The part-time model also wears large blackened contact lenses, alien like talons and unusual hair dye colours.

He said: ""So far, I've had $50,000 (£40,000) in skincare and procedures including two rhinoplasties, facial fillers in my lips, cheeks and brow bone all to look extra-terrestrial.

""I do kind of look like a Martian, I have a really big head, no eyebrows and I've just been connecting with that.

""When people ask me how I'd label myself, I tell them an 'extra-terrestrial, hot mess, self-obsessed' it's becoming my slogan.""

He was motivated to go under the knife after feeling like an outcast while growing up.

Vinny became an LGBTQ activist and feels like his look now represents his beliefs that “people shouldn't be labelled”.

Vinny said: ""Over the years, I've realised I'm not gay, bi, trans or any of these things, I just want to be me.

""I do it in to inspire the world in a certain way, I want people to stop labelling others or putting them in boxes.""

When out in public he draws much attention, which he believes is down to some of his unusual standout features and dress sense.

Vinny added: ""My large black contact lenses are a necessity, it's like my pearl necklaces, I wear them to walk around everywhere I can.

""They make my eyes look super massive, some people call it demonic but I think it looks beautiful like an animal.

""Also, my make-up is focussed around looking sex-less, I play with colour a lot, there's no shade I wouldn't experiment with.""

Vinny has found the public are split on his look, with some adoring his unusual appearance and others hurling abuse or trying to physically hurt him.

He said: ""Some people absolutely love me see me as a celebration and give a lot of compliments.

""I don't look real and people love it. Some people have said they want their kids to be like me and that I'm an inspiration for children who don't feel like they belong.

""Other times I've had shopping carts chucked at me or I've been considered a sexual object by men and woman, I'm used to not fitting in.

""Even when I was 16, I was wearing full body suits and eight inch platforms going outside in the day, so it feels very normal to me.""

Vinny is set to appear on The Plastics of Hollywood, a show that will house real life plastic surgery addicts together in attempts to nurture their talent.

He said: ""My goal is to change everyone's mind about human dolls.

""I'm trying to wake people up to show them that gender roles in society do not matter and show them that we need to be better human beings and nicer to one another.""

The TV show, which is set to be released in America, will follow a talent agency that tries to help them achieve Hollywood Fame without relying on their looks.

Marcela Iglesias, producer and presenter, said: ""Vinny is an alien new generation of new people who want to look different, in 15 years, hundreds of people will want to look like him.

""We're in an era where there's people who want to look like lizards, those who implant horns into their skulls and people with full-face tattoos like the guy in Suicide Squad who are working.

""We want to be the first agency who will treat these human dolls, alien dolls and cartoons as a normal part of the society that we're living in now.

""We have all these people, the freaks, weirdos and we want to make society understand them.""

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/592880/Child-beauty-pageant-stage-mum-academy-school","Mum splashes £25k transforming son and daughter into beauty pageant stars","Stephanie Murphy and her husband Gerard have forked over roughly €30,000 (£25,500) in the past six years turning their children into pageant stars.

But the Irish couple, who are both 32, believe that it’s money well spent because the pageants have boosted their kid’s confidence, taught them valuable social skills and made the family closer.

Stephanie, who is turning the family’s hobby in to a business, says her daughter Aisling begged her to enter a pageant at six – and now she competes globally.

Now the family are planning to move to New Zealand in July to set up a pageant school, so they can pass on their knowledge to a future generation of stars.

Stephanie said: “We will be moving to New Zealand this summer and now we plan to start a pageant school.

“We are sure it’s going to be a tremendous success, making every penny we have spent worthwhile.

“Hopefully, we will make enough to pay for anything our kids need in the future.

“Pageanting encourages self confidence and we’ve raised thousands for charity over the years too. It is a wonderful community to be part of.”

Stephanie revealed how she first joined the competition circuit after Aisling begged to take part in a pageant at six.

Now 12, Aisling has won crowns across the world in Ireland, the UK and Australia.

Aisling’s nine-year-old brother Cian and mum Stephanie have also started competing and have scooped their own titles.

Stephanie, who is also mum to Ollie, two, explained: “It all started when Aisling was six and watching Toddlers and Tiaras – a programme about pageants on TV.

“She said she wanted to do it, too, but we weren’t sure. She kept asking and we decided to look into it.

“We found a pageant being held in Ireland, so we decided to go and look at it before we entered her. The kids were all having so much fun and we decided to give it a go.

“At her first one, she had such a great time and ended up winning the whole thing outright. From that point on she was hooked.”

Two years later, the family moved to Australia and Aisling’s hobby took over their lives.

Stephanie continued: “The pageant scene there is incredible. We were living in Queensland, but we would fly back and forth all over the place.

“We would go to Sydney and to the Sunshine Coast. She was picking up titles at almost every single one. She was the ‘It’ girl at the time.”

In 2015, when the family returned to Ireland after missing friends and family, Aisling immediately threw herself into the growing pageant community and entered Junior Miss Ireland.

She was delighted when she won and Aisling’s excitement inspired Stephanie to step into the limelight.

Stephanie said: “There was a competition for Mrs Ireland. One of my friends said: ‘Come on. It will be a laugh.’ But she ended up pulling out.

“I was so nervous, but I did it anyway and I ended up being runner-up. I couldn’t believe it and I knew right away that I wanted to go back and win that crown.

“I gave it everything and got involved in charity work in the build up. I couldn’t believe it when I got first place in 2016 and now I’m Mrs Ireland.

“I was absolutely crying my eyes out. Aisling was bawling, too, although and she just kept telling me how proud of me she was.”

Electrician Gerard was also overjoyed to be married to Mrs Ireland.

Stephanie said: “He was delighted for me and incredibly proud.

“Winning gave me such a confidence boost at the time. I suffer from depression, but it did me the world of good. It made me realise how important it is for Aisling as well. It will make her strong.

“It is an expensive hobby, but it’s worth every penny, as it’s made us all feel better about ourselves, we’ve made friends on the pageant scene and it’s made us closer as a family.

“We know it costs tens of thousands of pounds but pageants are really important to my kids.”

Used to watching from the sidelines, Stephanie’s younger son Cian told his parents he wanted to get up on the stage as well – and of course he followed in his family’s award-winning footsteps.

Stephanie explained: “It’s not all about the girls.

“Cian recently came to me and asked if he could get involved, so he did his first pageant in January in Birmingham.

“He is very shy and doesn’t like to socialise, but he absolutely loved it and came away with a title as well, so we all have crowns now.”

Now the family hope their love of pageants will bring them business success.

The doting mum said: “We want to establish a pageant academy.

“The idea is that kids will come in and learn how to do routines, the model walk and public speaking skills. It’s just like kids who go to dance school.

“I realise pageants don’t appeal to everyone and we’ve been criticised for spending so much on them.

“I found that hard, at first, but it doesn’t bother me now.""

She added: “We have a lot of fun and the pageants have helped Aisling learn so many skills public speaking and how to interact with people.

“Until someone actually goes to a show and sees what happens, I don’t think it’s fair to comment.

“Pageanting has been amazing for us all and, who knows, maybe it will help us to make our fortunes now, too.""","boorish"

The 39-year-old has already undergone four surgeries to remove a massive 2st 5lbs tumour from his face after he was found to be suffering the world’s worst known case of neurofibromatosis.

The extreme condition, which started to manifest itself when Huang was just four-years-old, causes tumours to grow repeatedly on his face meaning he has been the subject of medical studies as well as in-depth documentaries over the past few decades.

He said: ""My tumour was enormous and heavy, I had to hold it while I was walking around.""

Huang is now living a relatively normal life despite new tumours growing at an alarming rate.

He also revealed that he’s turned down offers to join a ""freak show"" and refuses to be shown off as some sort of ""monster"".

The man from Yulan village in Yongxin County, central China, first went under the knife back in 2007.

In the years that followed, with the help of donations or pro bono operations, he underwent three more surgeries.

The procedures helped to reduce what was – and still is – the record for the world’s biggest facial tumour, but Huang’s appearance still stops him from venturing out into public.

The Chinese man only attended school for four years until he decided to drop out because of the cruel abuse he received from other children.

He now lives with his parents and siblings, who have become accustomed to his appearance.

Despite his nickname, Huang does not suffer from the disorder associated with the original “Elephant Man” Joseph Merrick who is thought to have had Proteus Syndrome.

Huang’s symptoms are different, but nonetheless debilitating, and his growths are reportedly developing once more.","boorish"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/591330/zoella-effect-heartthrob-posters-teenagers-posters-bedrooms","Teens ditch heartthrob posters as ‘Zoella-effect’ encourages youngsters to change","Posters on bedroom walls are being phased out in the modern day with just 7% of teens admitting that they put up giant sized pictures of their heroes compared to 79% in the 1990s.

Compared to the David Beckham poster, dream catcher, lava lamp and 'Groovy Chick' bedspread of old, the modern teen girls' bedroom is all about white painted walls, fairy lights and a full length mirror, with not a poster in sight - and it's all down to the likes of Zoella and Tanya Burr.

More than half of the teens surveyed claim that they want to show their own personality and their bedroom is a reflection of this.

So gone are the days of matchy-matchy everything – meaning the eighties trend of having a Troll-themed bed set, lamp shade, rug, bean bag, and wallpaper, or the matching Groovy Chick equivalent of the noughties, are gone.

However, almost half of people who grew up in the 1970s and a third of people who grew up in the 1980s said that matching bed linen, curtains and cushions were essentials to be ‘cool’.

The study of 4,000 females, conducted by George Home by Asda, compared the responses of 2,000 adult women aged 23-62 years old with the responses of 2,000 teenage females aged 13-19 years in order to paint a picture of how typical teenage bedrooms compare throughout the last fifty or so years.

The results show that millennials are increasingly opt for calming and tranquil décor – whereas most 53-62 year olds say they had patterned wall paper.

29% of 2017 teens say that they have white walls and plain fairy lights to replicate the typical style they see in the videos of the bedrooms and homes of their favourite Youtube vloggers.

A spokesperson for George Home at Asda, said: “Times are changing and so are people and especially our homes – none less so than the bedrooms of our teenagers, which when we make a comparison is something we can all relate to, whether adults or teenagers in 2017.

“In the past bedrooms typically tended feature similar items and a look a feel, as essentially friends tried to copy friends.

“In the modern day, access to the internet and superstar vloggers have played a huge role in changing this, driving a more grown-up approach and appreciate for trends and what’s current and popular with a much younger audience; via popular via their heavily subscribed Instagram, Youtube and Snapchat channel.

“It may be different to eras gone by, but perhaps the fact that teenage girls want to reflect their own individual style in their bedroom décor is a sign of empowerment and positive influence.

“With our new George Home range the collection is geared towards creating the bedroom of your dreams with our new range of furniture and bedding is affordable and stylish.”

The findings show that the millennial teen generation are effectively “skipping a phase” when it comes to their bedrooms – jumping straight from child hood to adult hood.

And the prime reason is the influence of social media stars, such as Zoella and Tanya Burr; along with others including the likes of Lydia Elise Millen, Lily Melrose, Sarah Ashcroft and Victoria Magrath.

Just over a third of 2017 teenagers say they think it is more important that their bedroom looks “grown up” than anything else – and the result is that we are seeing more traditional, timeless and classy taste in teen bedrooms, rather than the more faddy trends of years gone by.

Past generations had “fun” things such as glow in the dark stickers, cuddly toys and seemed to be less concerned with the way that they were perceived.

More than a third donned their walls with cut outs from magazines and newspapers (37%), which is unheard of in today’s digital age.

Technology has played a constant influential role – with the 1960s having record players, the 1980s cassette tapes and the 1990s CDs, which of course influenced the posters adorning bedroom walls across the UK, based on what people were listening to.

However in 2017, the role is different with 71% of teen bedrooms having a laptop and 88% smartphone, meaning ease of access to the internet is giving more influence to vloggers – but rather than putting up a poster of Zoella and the likes to worship them like a hero, teens can see what their equivalent bedrooms look like and therefore they actually want to simply “replicate” their styles.

1960s- If you are aged 63-72 then you grew up as a “teen of the sixties” and a typical teenage girl’s bedroom would have included: a Beatles poster, typewriter, transistor radio, newspaper cuttings on the wall and a shag pile rug.

1970s- If you are aged 53-62 then you grew up as a “teen of the seventies” and a typical teenage girl’s bedroom would have included: a rolling stones poster, crochet blanket, patterned wallpaper and pop art.

1980s - If you are aged 43-52 then you grew up as a “teen of the eighties” and a typical teenage girl’s bedroom would have included: a Michael Jackson poster, stereo radio cassette, pastel wall colours and a bed valance.

1990s - If you are aged 33-42 then you grew up as a “teen of the nineties” and a typical teenage girl’s bedroom would have included: a Take that poster, television, VCR and built in wardrobes.

2000s - If you are aged 23-32 then you grew up as a “teen of the noughties” and a typical teenage girl’s bedroom would have included: and David Beckham poster, dream catcher, lava lamp and glow-in the dark stickers

In 2017, it’s white painted walls, no posters, fairy lights and a full length mirror with make-up, hair straighteners and your tablet device all within reaching distance!

Troubled Danny has stopped filming and is currently in South Africa after he was urged by BBC bosses to sort his life out.

The Corporation says Danny is on a “short break” amid claims he was struggling to cope with the gruelling 16-hour filming schedule.

Programme makers have since been forced to hastily re-edit scripts and come up with a fresh storyline to cover the star’s absence.

Insiders say that the writers also considered sending Mick on a holiday or having him visit a sick relative far away.

But the jail plot is thought by insiders to be the easiest way of writing him out as it ties into a current storyline that saw Mick arrested.

The Queen Vic landlord was nicked after Aunt Babe was caught selling alcohol out of hours.

A source revealed: “Some said the prison storyline is by far the easiest way of cutting him out of the show at such short notice.

“Other ideas were tabled, but they wanted something to tie in with Mick’s turbulent life on the Square.

“And it will mean Danny could stay away for as long as he needs to recuperate and get back to work at which point Mick can be released from jail.”

The source added: “His departure from the soap has been a major headache for producers and they are desperate for his return.

But conspiracy theorists are convinced NASA is covering up evidence about “what’s really on the moon”.

Extraordinary claims circulating online suggest hostile aliens have banned human astronauts from ever returning to the moon.

Now the theory has resurfaced on conspiracy theory website Ancient Code.

A feature discussing the theory read: ""Have you ever asked yourself why mankind has not returned to the moon in recent years?

""According to many researchers and Ufologists, the American space agency is hiding a sinister secret from society, and we are not familiar with everything that has occurred—and is still occurring—on the surface of the moon.

""Many people claim there is enough evidence to suggest there are Alien bases on the moon.

""Rumors, declassified documents, and whistleblowers have come forward saying that agencies around the globe simply cannot afford to let society know what’s really on the moon.""

According to the wacky theory, aliens confronted Mr Armstrong during the first moon landing – and told him to never return.

The website added: ""The idea that there are alien bases on the moon would explain why we stopped so abruptly going to the moon.

""Also, with our current technology, why haven’t created a permanent manned outpost on the lunar surface?

""Wouldn’t it be easier to build a permanent structure on the surface of the moon, than to have a floating space station orbiting around Earth?""

But the ferocious beast had different plans.

As surprised tourists watch on the lion strangely appears to chaperone its newfound acquaintance.

The cat looks over its shoulder several times before picking up the little creature and taking them to a secluded spot behind a bush.

Better control over terrorism events could now be a reality thanks to Turkish and American data experts.

An amazing new plan for detecting suicide attacks by the Turkish Military Academy and The State University of New York compares past terror incidents to predict future attacks.

Social media monitoring by government bodies is now no longer as effective as it used to be because terrorists are taking extra care to cover their tracks, the boffins claim.

But the breakthrough blueprint claims to identify “useful patterns of suicide attacks” in order to “understand [terrorist] behaviours and their future moves”.

""For example, what is the relationship between the Paris and the 9/11 attacks?” asks Salih Tutun, one of the team at Binghamton University.

He said: “When we look at that, if there's a relationship, we're making a network.

""Maybe one attack in the past and another attack have a big relationship, but nobody knows.

“We tried to extract this information.""

Chewing through the details of 150,000 terror attacks between 1970 and 2015, the thinkbot spits out its predictions about future attacks – including the time, location and type of weapon used.

Identifying the likely places where a terror attack will strike could now be within our reach, which means better chances of protecting ourselves.

The report states: “Governments can understand what are the popular tactics to make a provision for defined locations”.

The “Framework to understand terrorist behaviours” is available to read online in Expert Systems With Applications.

Although researchers admit terrorism is “complex”, the model has shown itself to work with “more than 90% accuracy”.

Brainbox Tutun believes “terrorists are learning” and “we need to understand the patterns” now more than ever.

""Predicting terrorist events is a dream, but protecting some areas by using patterns is a reality.

But he could now be kicked out of the party in a row over whether he helped stop Nigel Farage getting a knighthood.

Mr Carswell is thought to have had secret talks about returning to the Tories at the next election.

But Conservative Party figures yesterday dismissed the idea, saying his presence continues to provoke internal fighting in Ukip.

One said: “Douglas is more useful where he is in Ukip than if we took him back. For the past two years he has helped Ukip remain plunged in a seemingly unending civil war. Why would we want to stop that?”

Ukip chiefs have called for a probe into claims the MP played a role in blocking a knighthood for Mr Farage.

Earlier this week the former Ukip leader said: “He’s been working against us ever since the General Election, working with his Tory friends, and working, frankly, not just to divide Ukip, but to neutralise Ukip in the referendum campaign. We should have got rid of him a long time ago.”

The answer will SHOCK you","Most people are curious about how their sex lives compare to other people's and you may wonder whether you’re having a “normal” amount of sex.

But now you can have an insight into everyone’s bedroom habits thanks to a new survey of more than 2,200 British men and women.

The survey, conducted by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, revealed how often the average single person is romping each month.

Can you guess which sex is getting more action?

It turns out men get down and dirty more frequently than women, with the average guy having sex twice per month.

However ladies confessed to just one steamy tumble between the sheets per month.

Previously researchers quizzed couples about how frequently they get laid and most lovers reported having sex once or twice each week.

Meanwhile sexperts recently weighed in on just how long your sex sessions should be lasting.

And believe it or not, great sex should go on for minutes and not hours.

A survey quizzed American and Canadian sex therapists – including psychologists, physicians, social workers, marriage/family therapists and nurses – about their thoughts on the ideal sex duration from penetration until ejaculation.

On average the sexperts agreed that a romp lasting one to two minutes was “too short”, three to seven minutes was “adequate”, seven to 13 minutes was “desirable” and 10 to 30 minutes was “too long”.

Researchers said: ""A man's or woman's interpretation of his or her sexual functioning as well as the partner's relies on personal beliefs developed in part from society's messages, formal and informal.""

They added: ""Unfortunately, today's popular culture has reinforced stereotypes about sexual activity.

""Many men and women seem to believe the fantasy model of large penises, rock-hard erections and all-night-long intercourse.""","vulgar"

The i-Con Smart Condom is billed as a new form of wearable technology which provides all the statistics men need to assess their sexual prowess.

This data includes duration of intercourse, calories burnt, number and speed of thrusts, girth measurements, and different positions used per week, month or year.

The device will also help detect sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia and Syphilis.

The Nottingham-based company says that all info will be kept anonymous - but users ""will have the option to share their recent data with friends, or, indeed the world.""

In a similar way to other health monitoring devices, it will use nano-chip and bluetooth technology to relay the data to a smartphone app.

Over 90,000 people have already pre-ordered the product which will be released later this year at the price of £59.99.

British Condoms, which has been delivering condoms and other products since 1999, revealed last year that it was developing the unique product.

Adam Leverson, lead engineer on the i.Con project said: ""Not only have we innovated the world's first smart condom ring - that'll measure pretty much every aspect of performance in the bedroom.

But now I'm pleased to confirm that it will also have built-in indicators to alert the users to any potential STIs present.""

The ring - which comes with a one year warranty - is worn at the base of the condom, is adjustable for size, and can be worn again and again.

It has an integrated micro USB port so it can be recharged, with each charge lasting about six to eight hours.

Aaron Slater, spokesperson for British Condoms, added: ""We knew we were on the cusp of creating something special with i.Con, and bringing a new meaning to 'wearable tech' - but being advocates of safe sex, we wanted something more, and the addition of an STI indicator has certainly done that.

""With over 96,000 pre-registrations for the product, we know that this is a complete game-changer.""

IllicitEncounters.com, the UK’s leading dating website for married people, has revealed a dramatic rise in the number of ladies signing up to do the dirty.

Figures show that over 35% more women registered in 2016 compared to 2010 and as much as 70% more than in 2006.

But is there a pattern, rhyme or reason behind cheating?

In a bid to find out, the site also studied over 2,000 female profiles to see what the average mistress looks like.

It turns out that middle-aged ladies (between 35 and 47) who earn £50,000 a year and have got a university degree under their belt are the most likely adulterers.

But why are more lusty ladies looking elsewhere for sex?

A large part of it is down to female empowerment, according to 60% of the 2,000 women polled, who said they realised that they no longer needed to be second-best in their relationship.

Moreover if their marriages hit the rocks, they felt motivated to do something about it.

More importantly women are, on average, earning more money meaning that they aren’t economically reliant on husbands and the threat of divorce isn’t what it once was.

In fact 75% of love rat ladies said they are the main breadwinner in their household.

Christian Grant, the site's spokesman, said: “Women have evolved far beyond the lonely, stereotypical housewife of 50 years ago.

""While gender pay gap issues still exist, women are earning more money and are more empowered than ever before, meaning that they can comfortably bulldoze past what is the biggest barrier to cheating for so many people.""

He added: ""They've come to realise that, if their marriage hits the rocks, why should they have to put up with it?

“They shouldn’t – and they don’t.”

Meanwhile a recent study revealed that women who fake orgasms during sex are more likely to do the dirty on their partner.

The research, published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour, quizzed 138 female and 121 male students who were in heterosexual relationships about climaxing and cheating.

Interestingly scientists found that the frequency and intensity of ladies’ orgasms had nothing to do with whether they had cheated before or were likely to cheat in the future.

But researchers did discover that infidelity was related to the number of orgasms a woman had faked.

In fact the more orgasms a woman had faked, the more likely she was to have strayed in the past and the more likely she was to cheat again in the future.

This means that faking it reveals more about how faithful she is than her actual orgasms.","vulgar"

The schlong condition, which actually affects half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70, is when a guy can’t get or maintain a hard enough erection for penetrative sex.

But it’s possible that the herbal supplement, also known as Panax ginseng, could be a performance-enhancing bedroom antidote and homeopathic alternative to Viagra.

In one study, published in the International Journal of Impotence Research, 60% of men suffering from mild to moderate ED had improved erections after swallowing Korean red ginseng supplements for eight weeks.

In particular researchers found that it had a small but significant effect in helping guys maintain erections and achieve successful penetration.

Researchers said: “Korean ginseng berry extract improved all domains of sexual function. It can be used as an alternative to medicine to improve sexual life in men.”

If you want to try the natural schlong saviour, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) advise taking 900mg of red ginseng three times a day.

We spoke to Dr Clare Morrison to get the low-down on how ginseng can revitalise your sex life.

She said: ""Panax ginseng is called the 'herbal Viagra' and does have some strong research behind its abilities.

""Research teams have reviewed seven studies of ginseng and ED and from this they concluded that there was suggestive evidence for the effectiveness of ginseng in the treatment of ED.

""Ginseng has been used for 2,000 years in Chinese and Korean medicine and is taken as a tonic for health. People often take the roots to help boost stamina and concentration, as well as to reduce stress.

""Studies have shown that ginseng can also help improve penile rigidity, duration of an erection, libido and even girth.""

But the medic warned of some potential side effects of swallowing Korean red ginseng supplements.

She said: ""The plant should only ever be considered for use on a short-term basis as a common side effect is insomnia.

""It can also interact badly with alcohol and some medications so do consult your doctor before using.

""There is evidence to suggest that there are herbal and natural remedies out there that can help with erectile dysfunction although not all of these methods are proven and should always be approached with caution, particularly if you have existing health conditions that you are already prescribed medication for.""

Speaking exclusively to Daily Star Online, the MedExpress.co.uk GP discussed the treatment options available to lads with erectile issues and the other potential penis potions that can be used to beat it.

She said: “Erectile dysfunction can be treated by taking medication, making lifestyle changes – such as quitting smoking, losing weight and even curbing your alcohol intake.

“With these changes and treatments erectile dysfunction can be cured in the short term, however it cannot be guaranteed that it won’t come back later in life.""

Dr Clare continued: “There are variety of different treatment options available for those who suffer with erectile dysfunction.

""These include oral medications (such as Viagra and Cialis), self-injections, testosterone replacement and even suppositories.

“The most common form of treatment is for the sufferer to take oral medications.

""These help to enhance the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical in the body that relaxes the muscles in the penis.

“This in turn increases the blood flow and helps the sufferer achieve an erection after sexual stimulation.

The health expert added: “The medications do vary in dosage, duration and possible side effects, however a doctor will take into account different situations and the lifestyle of the person in question and determine from this which medication will work best.

“There are natural treatments available for sufferers to try out, however these are not guaranteed to work.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/592470/Best-penis-size-for-orgasms-how-to-give-women-more-orgasms","Men with THIS penis size give women the most orgasms, study reveals","Penis size has long been either a bragging right or a sore spot for many men.

And while countless surveys have proved women care more about a myriad of other things over the size of a man’s penis, a new study has shown a particular sized penis can gives women more orgasms.

The study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found this sized penis can give women more vaginal orgasms, but not necessarily clitoral orgasms.

The researchers revealed men with longer penises make women climax more often.

“Research indicates that women's orgasm during penile–vaginal intercourse is influenced by fitness-related male partner characteristics, penis size is important for many women, and preference for a longer penis is associated with greater vaginal orgasm consistency,” the study authors wrote.

The researchers added these orgasms were achieved “without concurrent clitoral masturbation”.

The researchers came to this conclusion after asking women to report how much sex they were having, what type of sex and the effects of a longer than average penis on how often they orgasmed.

After they had the women report on the amount of orgasms they achieved from penile-vaginal intercourse, they concluded the longer the penis, the more orgasms the women experienced.

“Women who prefer deeper penile–vaginal stimulation are more likely to have vaginal orgasm, consistent with vaginal orgasm evolving as part of a female mate choice system favouring somewhat larger than average penises,” the researchers explained.

Keeping in mind only 20% of women on average can orgasm from vaginal penetration alone, a longer penis would help women achieve the three main types of vaginal orgasm.

This is because a longer penis would be able to hit the right spots easier.

These orgasms include the G-spot orgasm, the A-spot orgasm and the cervix orgasm.

However, men with shorter stallions, don’t fret as a separate study has found a “golden trio” of moves that can guarantee an orgasm every time.

Meanwhile, the man with the world longest penis – nearly 20 inches in length – is unable to have sex because it’s too long.","vulgar"

The average guy blows his load after roughly 5 minutes in the sack while women usually need around 18 minutes to climax.

It’s not hard to see why a whopping 80% of ladies wish their partners would last longer in bed.

Some lads will resort to thinking about football or doing complex maths equations to take their mind off the act, but there’s another way you can guarantee you’ll go all night.

Research has shown that spritzing a “delay spray” on your penis can help to prolong sex and boost your staying power by a massive 64%.

A recent study tested out climax-controlling product Promescent to see how it would affect couple’s sex lives.

The spray was proven to delay the time to ejaculation significantly (by roughly 4 minutes) as well as increasing the likelihood of women having an orgasm by 50%.

We spoke to Stephen De Pretre, Promescent’s international sales and distribution vice president, to get the low-down on how delay spray slows down sex and improves bedroom experience.

In an exclusive interview with Daily Star Online, Stephen said: “At the moment, if men want to last longer, they have few options available to them.

“They can either start focussing away from the moment or they can use a numbing spray.

“Neither are ideal as they either take away the attention from having an intimate moment with your partner or they take away too much sensitivity and thus sexual enjoyment by numbing a man’s penis too much.

“Promescent helps men to last longer so a couple has more time to focus purely on each other and the psychical and emotional enjoyment that comes with that, without having to get too distracted about trying not to have an orgasm just yet.

“This extra time really improves the intimacy in a relationship and ensures a better sexual experience for both partners.”

Stephen explained the science behind the product and how it can help men make love for longer – but without sacrificing any pleasure.

He said: “The active ingredient of Promescent is Lidocaine.

“Lidocaine was developed in 1942 and clinically introduced by the Swedish anaesthesiologist and Nobel laureate Dr Gordh. It has been safely used for topical anaesthesia since World War II by dentists, physicians, plastic surgeons, etc.

“In relation to the time it takes to ejaculate, Lidocaine helps to delay the ejaculation by diminishing the glans or penile sensitivity.

“Because the glans becomes less sensitive, it delays the spinal reflex responsible for ejaculation and thus the ejaculation gets delayed.

He added: “Promescent only needs to be applied on a coin-sized area and its patented technology allows the product to get rapidly absorbed through the skin where it then stops for a longer period of time.

“This allows people to enjoy the delaying effect created by Lidocaine without sacrificing sexual enjoyment and whilst maintaining next to normal sensitivity.”","vulgar"

Eight women have bravely opened up about their micropenis-related sexual encounters in a candid Reddit thread.

Here are some of their stories:

1. Big turn off

One woman revealed she found her sexual partner’s tiny todger off-putting, but was willing to give things a go.

”I was turned off, but felt like it would be mean to stop because of that so we went ahead and had sex, though I couldn't feel anything”

“I didn't see him again after that... told him that I just didn't feel like we had good chemistry. It was a very awkward situation all around.”

2. Size isn’t everything

“I’ve slept with one guy with a huge penis and two with very small penises.

“One of the guys was pretty good in bed... he made up for his lack of size in many other different ways.”

3. You can learn

An open-minded lover said: ”I’m a pretty firm believer that size doesn't matter and that it is purely down to the individuals interest in sex and willingness to learn.”

4. Connection is key

""I've been with lots of guys. A few of them had extremely tiny penises (like micropenis status).

“I ended things with them for entirely different reasons.

""I definitely would have been willing to work around the small penis if I really felt a connection with either of them.”

5. Personality is more important

“If I met them and grew to know and like them for their personality, humour and a nice body would def [sic] help. I think I could enjoy it.”

6. Sex comes first

“I’m going to say what no one else seems to be willing to: sometimes sex is make or break.

“I would say give it a shot, but if it really isn't working and if it really doesn't feel good, then it's probably not worth your time continuing on with a relationship with this individual.

""At least not a romantic one. Sex is a huge part of intimacy and intimacy is a huge part of any romantic partnership.”

7. Experiment with positions

“I slept with a guy who had a very small penis.

“He put me into some positions I'd never been in before and it was great. You/your partner will possibly just have to work the angles a little more but fun times can still be had.”

8. Caring lover

“In my personal experience, I've found that guys who are smaller (at least in comparison to others I've had) are considerably more giving in bed.”","vulgar"

1. They frequently accuse you of cheating

PetticoatBandit said: ”Every relationship I had that ended because I found out they were cheating had one common denominator: They frequently accused me of cheating.

“Like, all the time. I have never cheated. For example, my last ex accused me of making plans to go cheat on them with an actor from TV.

“I didn't even know the actor's real name, I just thought the actor was cute. Cue huge fight. Find out later they've been cheating on me with just a friend, don't worry.

“Five years later the ridiculousness of it still strikes me from time to time.""

2. Suspicious phone activity

Phlox_carolina said: ”I suspected that him talking on the phone in the driveway for a half hour each night after she went to bed was not business-related.""

While Ashbrincon added: ”My high school boyfriend never saved phone numbers into his phone. He claimed he was just ""too lazy."" Turns out the unsaved numbers belonged to his many many side girls.""

3. They want MORE sex

Reddit user imnogoodatthisorthat said: ""A sudden increase in sexual desire towards you.""

""Having a new sexual partner makes you feel sexier and hornier.

“They might be getting it from someone else, but out of guilt and convenience, they'll likely be more sexual towards you as well, in ways they weren't before.""

4. They lie about where they are

Reddit user sericatus said: ""I think, in my life, I am five to one in this category. Six times in my life, a SO has lied about where they were. Five times, they were cheating.

“The other time, they were picking out a Valentine's gift for me.""

5. They go missing with no explanation

User 35palas12 said: ""Long periods of time in which you cannot account for their whereabouts.

""And when they do tell you where they have been, they tell you a detailed story, in which they progressively fill in the details because it is a lie. Sad!""

6. They blame you for relationship problems

Alloutofdietcoke said: ""I could tell he was growing increasingly distant. He would tell me I wasn't putting the effort into our relationship, but when I tried to be more attentive and loving, he would withdraw.

“And then one awesome night, I asked him if there was someone else. He had a panic attack [that] left him unable to breathe, and his uncle [and I] rushed him to the ER.

“For two weeks after, he would send me pictures of the toll the attack had taken on his eyes and skin. I felt like a monster.

“It turned out that I had just hit the nail on the head and unnerved him. The worst part is that his whole family knew and had been helping him hide it because they thought I was an awful person due to some lies he had been feeding them.

“His uncle was paying for the secret cell phone. Everyone was encouraging him to leave me for her, not knowing I had been paying the majority of the household expenses and had been doing everything I could think of to make him happy.

Swingers resorts are becoming more and more popular and there are now many resorts around the world where you can participate in group sex.

Here are five of the best swingers hotels located close to home:

1. La Mirage Swingers, Gran Canaria, Spain

La Mirage consists of 32 individual bungalows – some with connecting doors – a swimming pool, two whirl pools, pool bar and various game rooms for couples.

The hotel includes a couples lounge, rainfall showers and themed evenings.

3. Paradise Hotel, Blackpool, UK

Blackpool’s Paradise Hotel is currently owned by Sue and Keith Locke who have said the hotel is for “swingers” and “liberated adults”.

Sue said the hotel has a wide range of guests ranging from solicitors to police officers and they are fully booked nearly every week.

“We even had an ex-chief constable come to stay with his partner and recently we had a disabled lady visit us,” Sue said. “She had an absolute ball and slept with seven men in one night.”

Located on the idyllic island of Corfu, Greece this boutique hotel has four bedrooms and is clothing optional.

5. The Toren, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

While not explicitly advertised as a swingers hotel, the Toren has been described by a visitor as “a gateway to uninhibited nudity, sex, culture, museums, more sex and amazing dance clubs.”

The hotel itself is housed in two buildings that date back to the 17th century and boasts views of the Keizersgracht canal – they also have whirlpools in select rooms.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/592372/What-men-want-in-bed-sex-tips-for-women","Three things men secretly want in bed","When it comes to sex, it often seems women get the short end of the stick.

Only 20% of women are able to orgasm from vaginal penetration alone and a recent study revealed only 65% of straight women orgasm every time they have intercourse compared to 95% of straight men.

A recent survey asked 6,700 men and women about their sex lives and found 71% of women were either “thrilled” or “satisfied” with them.

The results from the men, who were having the same amount of sex as the women, showed only 51% of them were “thrilled” or “satisfied” with their sex lives.

So what gives? ""'I feel bad about my body' is a sentence I've heard more and more often in the past five years,"" male sexuality specialist Daniel Lebowitz told Women’s Health.

""A combination of male objectification—think of Zac Efron's abs in the Baywatch trailer—and porn has played a part in men feeling like they don't measure up and doubting their abilities in bed.”

“Women have been feeling body-image pressure for years, so they're able to identify it and speak up about it. But for many men, there's a sense of isolation. It can make them feel like their own sex life isn't good enough.""

Leibowitz added men still feel there is an expectation for them to be “in charge” in the bedroom, which can add pressure and diminish the gratification from their sexual experience.

These are three things, according to sexperts, that men really want in bed:

1. Dress up

Your man wants you to dress up for him occasionally – and no, not in an erotic getup but we guarantee he’d enjoy that too – but primp and prime like you would on a night out.

This will show him you still want to impress him which can both reassure him and make him feel more masculine – which in turn will make him feel more desired and confident in the bedroom.

2. Tell him your fantasies

Leibowitz said the more settled you feel in a relationship, the harder it is for you to tell your partner what it is you really want or really want to try in bed incase you hurt their feelings.

But communication is the cornerstone of any good relationship, so perhaps mention you’d like to try a different move or both write down things you’d like to experiment with. This is the easiest way to add spice to any sex life.

3. Initiate sex

This doesn’t have to mean jumping him as soon as he arrives home, it can be something as small as putting his hand on your thigh while you watch TV or making the first move while you undress for bed.

This will take the pressure off him to always make the first move and initiate sex, and will make him feel more desired.","vulgar"

As they walk through the eerie corridors they spot creepy-looking wallpaper showing menacing figures.

Satanic symbols are seen scrawled across the doors and walls but the worst is yet to come.

As Steve talks to the camera, a mysterious figure appears behind him at the back of the corridor.

Footsteps can be heard before a bang as if the figure is shutting a door.

“Guys did you hear that?” he says. “That was seriously two loud bangs – I don’t know what the f*** that was.”

Josh then appears and looks equally perplexed, saying: “I’m getting the f*** out of here.”

The two friends then run down the stairs and desperately try to escape the asylum.

After several heart-stopping minutes they manage to find the exit.

More than 3.8 million people have viewed the spine-tingling footage since it was posted on YouTube.

“OMG that scared the s*** out of me,” one horrified user commented.

Shot at the Idube Game Reserve on the outskirts of the Kruger National Park in South Africa, the stunning footage captures the grizzly but fascinating feast.

In the clip, the hyena carries the head in its teeth before placing it down on the floor and taking a bite.

Despite being one of its own, the hyena savage licks its lips before tucking into its prey.

A group of tourists on safari watch in astonishment at the gruesome sight.

“There’s not a lot of it left to be able to tell what happened here,” a man can be heard saying.

The cannibal killer rips into the dead hyena's flesh before leaving it for another of the group to tuck in.

“It doesn’t seem to be bothered that its another one of its own kind either,” the man off camera says.

According to a description alongside the graphic video, the remains of the animal may have belonged to another hyena clan.

Clans can consist of up to 80 hyenas who hunt as a pack, with females dominating.

It is thought the hyena may have been killed by lions before the clan descended and feasted on its remains.

“Funny how watching them feed on another kind of animal is fine, but seeing this creeps me out,” one shocked viewer commented on the clip online.

Another describe the video as “brutal, yet awesome” with a third saying: “Wow, you can't get more carnivorous than that, to eat your own.”

“Fascinating and gross in equal measure,” another viewer added.

“Oh my f****** god are you getting it?” the camera man asks.

The young lad responds: “Yes I’m getting it, it’s horrid.”

An avalanche of brown and grey pus continually streams from his face before the bloke picks up some tweezers to properly get rid of the phlegmy discharge.

The 43rd President of the United States remained coy – and did not give much away while being pressed yesterday on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

Bush – who was president from 2000 to 2008 – simply replied “maybe” when asked about whether he looked at the documents.

He then repeatedly said he would not give anything away, even “when he is 90” – and suggested he would take the secrets to the grave.

Kimmel asked Bush whether he would tell him what was in the files, and he said “no”.

Kimmel said: ""Now that you're out of office you can do anything you want, right?”

The deal has prompted speculation over the upmarket brand’s future – and whether it will still be able to attract the top celebrities it has bagged as models in the past.

A-listers have queued up to don the AP smalls and pose in risque photoshoots, but may be more reluctant to peel off if they feel it has lost its high-end charm.

Kate Moss acted out naughty fantasies for a series of web adverts entitled The Four Dreams Of Miss X.

In one she stripped off to show her skimpy undies before peeling off and caressing her boobs. Millions logged on, crashing the site.

Kylie Minogue rode a mechanical bull in just her skimpies in an advert shown at cinemas and deemed too raunchy for TV.

And Abbey Clancy steamed up a winter wonderland in stockings and suspenders for a 2015 campaign.

In 2008, model Daisy Lowe strutted down the catwalk, baring her bum and boobs in skimpy thongs and nipple tassels at a live AP show.

Pixie Geldof peeled off, as did Atlanta de Cadenet – daughter of Duran Duran’s John Taylor and Amanda de Cadenet.

Most recently, Israeli model and Leonardo di Caprio’s ex Bar Refaeli appeared in a sizzling campaign.

Mike Ashley, 52, sealed the £25million deal through his investment vehicle Four Holdings, buying the brand from private equity firm 3i.

It currently has 10 British stores and 600 employees. But it was branded “a phenomenal stitch-up” by co-founder Joe Corre – the son of Vivienne Westwood – who called it “a disgrace to British business” and compared Mr Ashley to a carrion bird “picking at a carcass”.

The controversial billionaire has been accused of running his companies like a “Victorian workshop” and admitted paying staff less than the minimum wage.

But AP insiders are hoping he is the man to revive the fortunes of the label, which many think is just too expensive.

The priciest knickers cost a staggering £395 – enough to buy you 316 pairs of Miso ladies briefs at Sports Direct.

AP bras start at £75 and the costliest is the Teigan bra at £895.

The matching Teigan suspender belt is £695. For the cost of the Teigan bra, you could snap up 32 Puma men’s tracksuits or 30 Manchester United football shirts.

But now, six years on, the 18-year-old remains stranded in hospital, emaciated and paralysed.

Chloe, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: ""At first, my family and I didn't put two and two together.

""We thought the vaccine was safe because they give it in schools and on the letter the parents were given to sign consent I remember reading 'it saves lives'.""

She said in the months that followed getting the injection at school, she fell ill with dizziness, headaches, fatigue and bone and joint pain - which left her muscles weakened.

She has now lost three stones, dropping to just 5st and is now being fed through a tube.

For years, doctors told Chloe the condition was in her head but now some believe the injection triggered an autoimmute response, causing her body to attack itself.

The teen said: ""We trust our government to keep us safe but now, since getting sick from something the NHS gave me I don't trust any medical professionals that I don't know.

""Why? Because I've been treated in such a barbaric way. It's been ill on earth.""

Shocking photos show her hooked to wires and drips, as she lies in a hospital - where she has been for the past 11 months.

Her mother, Sophie Brookes, 41, has been forced to give her job up as a hairdresser to become her full-time carer.

The 18-year-old is certain her symptoms are linked to the vaccine, which protects against the human papilloma virus and cause cervical caner - this kills around 900 women a year.

She said: ""I danced six days a week and loved to go to after-school sport and dance clubs every night. I was on the right road to getting A's at GCSE.

""I wanted to have a dance career and my heart bleeds with the torture knowing I may never walk again and therefore ever dance again.""

Parents have called for more research into the jab, which has been a routine offered to 12 and 13-year-old girls since 2008.

Chloe became ill between her second and third injection of the Cervarix vaccine in late 2010 and the summer of 2011.

She came down with a string of viruses, started experiencing debilitating muscle pain and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

A gastrointestinal disorder left her in agony every time she ate or lost control of her bladder.

She was later diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome which causes abnormal heart rate.

A year after having the injection, Chloe also began experiencing paralytic episodes and collapsing at school, unable to control her lower body.

She said: ""I'm not scaremongering, I just care about others. This is real. This is the pure ugly truth. I want to make people aware so they can make decisions for themselves.""

Cervarix was given to 6 million girls and while it is no longer offered to girls at school by the NHS, a new HPV vaccine, Gardasil is.

European Medicines Agency statistics show that up to January 2017, 3,683 reactions to Cervarix were reported and 11,802 to Gardasil.

Some 380 families, represented by the UK Association for Vaccine Injured Daughters, have called for more information in schools and research into potential side effects.

Medics have dismissed their concerns and NHS England insists that the jab is not dangerous, writing on its website that it is a ""safe vaccine"".

Freda Burrell, of the UK Association for Vaccine Injured Daughters, said: ""Many medical professionals will not link the vaccine to the girls' health problems.

""Yet common sense should speak loudly if their medical records were excellent prior to the vaccine and their health changed dramatically after they had the jab.""

Public Health England and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued a joint statement in response to the claims.

They said: ""As with all vaccines, the safety of the HPV vaccine is under constant review. Every report of a suspected side effect is taken seriously.""

""That there is no credible evidence of a link between the HPV vaccine and a range of chronic illnesses.""

They concluded: ""The European Medicines Agency has also rued out a link to Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.""","dramatic"

Ancients bones from around 100,000 years ago were uncovered in Lingjing, China.

Intense tests on the skulls revealed the shock revelation of humans interbreeding in ways previously unseen by the fossil record.

They come from the Pleistocene – or Ice Age – era of history which lasted from about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago.

Scientists unveiled the skulls are part-human and part-Neanderthal and are possibly a new species.

Neanderthals were ancient humanoids who were short, stocky with thick skulls featuring large noses and heavy ridges on their brows.

The skulls dug-up in China are believed to belong to the little-known relatives of mankind the “Deniso­vans” – of which there currently only exists DNA from a finger bone and a tooth found in Siberia.

“Eastern Asian late archaic humans have been interpreted to resemble their Neanderthal contemporaries to some degree,” said Xiujie Wu, an author of the new study at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

""Yet it is only with the discovery of two human crania that the nature of these eastern Eurasian early Late Pleistocene archaic humans is becoming clear.”

She added the fossils could represent ""“a kind of unknown or new ar­chaic human that survived on in East Asia to 100,000 years ago”.

“It is a very exciting discovery,” said Katerina Harvati, an expert in Neanderthal evolution at the University of Tübingen.

“Especially because the human fossil record from East Asia has been not only fragmentary but also difficult to date.”

She added: “The remains show an intriguing combination of Neanderthal-like as well as archaic features

""This would be the combination that one would expect based on the ancient DNA analysis of Denisovans, who were closely related to Neanderthals.”

The new discovery suggests more interbreeding between different types of humans – with studies suggesting modern mankind are between 1-3% Neanderthal.

Humanity’s early history is still being pieced together be scientists, who two years ago uncover a new species of ancient human in Ethiopia.

Last week, scientists revealed the incredible “hellmouth” crater in Siberia which is revealed an ancient world lost of thousands of years as the permafrost melts.","dramatic"

Subsequent tweets posted within the next 30 minutes claimed Obama tapped his office in October despite being ""turned down by court earlier"".

It comes after the pair met at the White House in a slightly awkward meeting and photo session.

Another fuming tweet branded the alleged tapping ""McCarthyism"" – which means using unfair investigative techniques.

He posted: “Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!”

He also compared the allegations to the Watergate scandal, which led to the impeachment of Richard Nixon for a break-in at the Democrat's HQ.

It has been deployed to war-ravaged Palmyra frontline in a bid to prevent ISIS forces from recapturing the city for a third time.

The soldiers have been specially trained to defend government facilities in rural areas in the country.

Russian war chiefs said the troops will be responsible for protecting liberated oil fields and weapons storage facilities in western Palmyra.

Video showing ISIS terror thugs destroying the ancient Roman theatre in the city surfaced in January.

Horrified officials called it a ""new war crime"" and an ""immense loss for the Syrian people and for humanity"".

BBC News have claimed the studio was in use at the time of the intrusion but the ""pranksters'"" were not seen on the screen.

The footage shows the young lads inside the studios and boasting: ""Guys, right now, we're in the BBC headquarters and we're gonna try and run on live TV.

""Guys, literally yeah, I ran on the set of BBC News! And it's crazy, the video is going to be out on Sunday.""

The clip then appears to show the group at the top of Broadcasting House and also at the set of the One Show where Ed Sheeran performed on Friday night.

The footage continues: ""So guys, apparently Ed Sheeran's meant to be performing here right now.

""We must streak it out or we might climb the building itself…""

The pranksters ended their clip with a promise that the full video will be released on Sunday at 6pm.

But a young lad appeared to confuse the BBC studio with Sky News.

He said: ""So guys, I'm with these lot [points to group at London Underground station].

""We literally just ran on Sky News.

""Literally so mad.

Well, it's probably more than you think.

Sex, oral sex and kissing are not only great for your relationship and happiness levels, they are also beneficial to your physical health.

A 10st 7lb can burn 144 calories having full-blow sex or 100 calories per half an hour giving oral.

That's the equivalent of walking for 35 minutes or doing 15 hardcore minutes on the rowing machine.

But how would women rather beat the bulge?

Daily Star Online conducted a poll asking women “How would you rather burn 100 calories?”

The options were: Giving oral sex, cycling for 23 minutes or doing a 20-minute yoga session.

And there was one overriding winner – oral sex. Of the 12,088 ladies who took part in the poll a whopping 80% said they would rather burn calories giving oral sex because it’s “fun for everyone”.

Only 14% said they would rather go on a 23 minutes bike ride and a measly 6% would opt for yoga.

If you want to ramp up your calorie-burn in the bedroom Los Angeles–based sexologist Jaiya Kinzbach, recommends doing push-ups during the act or even trying out some yoga.

""You can do a little yoga,"" she said. ""Try plank position into downward facing dog, and back into plank where you can lower down and do some oral stimulation.""

You can blast an extra 71 calories by adding the occasional push-up and a further 35 doing some yoga moves.","vulgar"

Good news for all you people already having sex on the regular: a new study has suggested having sex once per week is the equivalent of earning an extra £40,420 per year.

The study conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Toronto wanted to find exactly why regular sex is so good for our wellbeing.

The research, published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin surveyed 335 Americans online and asked the about their relationships.

They asked how often they had sex, how happy they were and how often they kissed or cuddled with their partners.

Researchers also repeated this experiment with 74 couples in San Francisco.

Then, they asked 106 Swiss couples to keep a diary and the couples who had the most sex over a 10-day period were the happiest and had the highest relationship satisfaction.

Researchers also did a follow-up study on the same couples and found those who had sex more frequently were more likely to report “experiences of affection” during the hours after having sex and not just immediately afterwards.

The study also revealed the main reason as to why sex can contribute to long-term happiness: cuddling.

“When engaging in sex, people not only seek an intimate connection, but indeed experience more affection, both when having sex and in the next several hours,” the study authors wrote.

“Hence sex seems not only beneficial because of its physiological or hedonic effects, but because it promotes a stronger and more positive connection with the partner.”","vulgar"

But did you know there’s something you can do in the bedroom that’s very deadly?

While experimenting with your partner’s body can be lots of fun, a certain shocking sexual technique could kill your lover in as little as half an hour.

One of the riskiest things you can do is to powerfully blow air into a woman’s vagina – without allowing any of it to escape.

Although it's rare, the dangerous act can cause a woman to die from an air embolism which is when air enters the bloodstream and causes a blockage in a blood vessel.

Depending on where the blood vessel is in the body, the air bubble could lead to a stroke, heart attack or even a pulmonary embolism.

But if you and your lover enjoy the sensation of blowing air during oral sex, then gently breathing on the vulva is safe as long as it’s not directly into her vagina.

Meanwhile men are also at risk in the bedroom and guys can do some serious damage to their manhoods if they indulge in risky bedroom behaviour.

From certain crotch-compromising sex positions to vigorous masturbation, it’s possible for a man to actually break his penis in the throes of passion.

Fortunately penile fracture is rare, but beware of these unsafe moves just incase.

Here are the top three most dangerous sex acts for men:

1. Girl On Top

You might think sex is pretty safe, but a recent study found that the popular woman-on-top position is the most dangerous for men.

The raunchy position, which is one of the best positions to make a woman orgasm, was deemed responsible for half of all penile fractures according to researchers in Brazil.

Scientists believe it is because the woman controls the penis with her entire body weight landing on it and is unable to interrupt it when it suffers a ""wrong way penetration"".

2. Anal sex

Not only was the Doggy Style sex position voted the third most dangerous for lads, but anal sex itself can also spell bad news for your schlong.

Anal sex puts your penis at risk of fracture because it involves putting a lot of pressure on your downstairs – heightening the chance of an accident.

It’s also possible for the partner receiving anal to bend too far forward and overextend the penis.

3. Vigorous masturbation

Solo sex is perfectly normal – and it can be good for your health – but you should be careful about doing it in unusual or risky situations.

Masturbating too hard or at the wrong angle can lead to unfortunate consequences such as a broken penis.

Two real-life examples of penile fractures include a man who masturbated in a moving car – and then hit the dashboard – and a guy who pleasured himself with a cocktail shaker.","vulgar"

But now researchers have quizzed lovers on the dirtiest places they have ever done the deed – and it seems that there are few boundaries we are not willing to cross.

Public toilets, forests, fields and festival tents were all high on the list of locales frequented, with Brits seemingly having a disregard for dirt.

Rather more shockingly, respondents also admitted to getting amorous in a swamp, a festival portaloo and in the hallowed halls of Parliament.

Horny couples also shared their top motivation for venturing out into the open, with 59% saying it was due to the thrill and excitement of leaving the comfort of the bedroom.

The survey, commissioned by on-demand domestic services company Fantastic Services, found that while dirt is a turn on outside, it’s a real turn off in a relationship.

A massive 95% said that a dirty home would put them off a potential partner.

Rune Sovndahl, co-founder of Fantastic Services, said: “We certainly received some eye-opening confessions, but many of the results were not a surprise in the slightest.

“We regularly see first-hand how clean and fastidious so many people are, so the fact that almost all said that a dirty house would put them off a partner makes perfect sense.

“There’s a real difference between a bit of dirt outside and the grime that can plague our houses if we’re not careful.

“I think this shows that many people are up for a bit of fun, but when it comes to letting standards slip, it’s a completely different matter.

“It seems we want our homes to be clean, tidy and restful; they are after all our sanctuary.

""However, we aren’t afraid to brave the dirt as long as it’s banned from the bedroom.”

Meanwhile public sex is actually a very common sexual desire for women.

According to the Journal of Sexual Medicine, a group of researchers questioned 799 women aged 20 to 40 about their sexual fantasies.

Three of the top 12 fantasies for women included having sex in public with 81.7% of the women surveyed stating they have fantasised having sex in an unusual place - i.e. in the office or in public toilets.

In comparison women spend an average of £65 per month, or £780 annually, trying to entice men.

The survey by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk quizzed more than 2,000 singles on their sex lives and spending habits, including which items they were most likely to splurge on.

Guys were most likely to spend on wining and dining with alcohol being the most popular answer, followed by food or dining out.

But the other top responses focused on keeping up appearances as 16% admitted to shelling out for a gym membership and 9% stumped up cash for new clothes to ensure they impress the opposite sex.

As for ladies, they were most likely to pay out for sexy lingerie (24%), new clothes (22%) or perfume (19%) in a bid to seduce.

George Charles, spokesperson for the money-saving site, said: “It’s still quite shocking to see just how much more men spend on average when compared to women when it comes to sex.

Since his presidential inauguration in January the Slovenian former model has captured the world's hearts for being spotted looking miserable around her husband, shuddering in his presence and laughing at him.

But what happened to his previous wives Marla Maples and Ivana Trump?

Here's all you need to know.

Ivana Trump (1977-91)
Czechoslovakian Ivana Zelnickova was the first woman to become Mrs. Trump and the woman to give him the nickname The Donald.

After attending University in Prague Ivana became an avid skier and is said to have been listed as an alternate for the Czechoslovakian 1972 Winter Olympics team.

Ivana met Donald in New York – while promoting the Montreal games – and after a whirlwind courtship they married on April 7, 1977, before becoming huge high society names for most of the 1980s.

The pair had three children together; Donald John Jr., Ivanka Marie and Eric Fredrick and started running The Trump Organization together with Ivana as Vice President.

But – after 14 years together – the marriage broke down.

Rumours of Donald playing away from home with model Marla Maples became hot news across the world in 1990 and were exacerbated by Ivana picking up the phone in their family home to hear her voice.

She encountered Marla on a ski resort in Aspen, Colorado, at Christmas in 1990 and it did not go well.

In an interview with Barbara Walters at the time, the Czech recalled: ""Marla came up to me and said 'I'm Marla and I love your husband. Do you?'""

""I said 'Get lost. I love my husband very much'.""

She added that Donald said nothing during the confrontation the duo soon divorced.

Speaking of their separation Donald said: ""Putting a wife to work is a dangerous thing.

""If you're in business for yourself I really think it's a bad idea to put your wife working for you.

""I think it was the single, greatest cause of what happened to Ivana.""

But far from crying over what could have been, the 68-year-old Ivana has lived a great life since.

She signed to a top Hollywood agent, developed lines of clothing, fashion jewellery and beauty products.

The businesswoman bought shares in Croatia's second biggest newspaper and has had several books published as well as playing a role in Hollywood film The First Wives Club where she uttered the line: ""Don't get mad, get everything.""

Ivana didn't quite get everything in her split with Trump but she did come away with a nice little goodbye package.

The blonde socialite reportedly got $14m (£11m) as well as an apartment at Trump Plaza, a 45-room estate, access to their Palm Beach, Florida, home and a private club.

Trump sued Ivana for violating a divorce gagging order but they are now on good terms.

Ivana even admitted she occasionally advises him, revealing last year that she told Donald to ""be more calm”.

She also added: ""He's no politician. He's a businessman. He's knows how to talk.""

Ivana has been married and divorced twice since, to Italian businessman Riccardo Mazzucchelli and pop star Rossano Rubicondi.

Her current net worth is $60m (£48m).

Marla Maples (1993-99)

Trump's only fully American wife was Marla Maples from Cohutta, Georgia.

The small-town girl quickly moved into showbusiness as a model and actress.

The beauty bagged a part in Stephen King's creepy 1986 movie Maximum Overdrive, hit Will Smith sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and appeared as a guest at WWE's WrestleMania 7.

She met Trump in 1989 at the age of 26 and soon fell for the businessman after he reportedly showered her with expensive gifts, secretly went on dates with her in plush limos and whisked her away to his famous Palm Beach mansion for flings.

Marla got what she ""was praying for for a long time"" and the pair married at New York City's Plaza Hotel once she fell pregnant with Tiffany in 1993.

Their relationship hit headlines many times especially when Trump admitted to ""making out"" with Marla during childbirth.

Marla told reporters that her lovemaking with Trump was ""the best sex I've ever had”.

But – like with Ivana – it all fell apart.

According to a People magazine article of that year a friend said Donald was ""more in lust than in love"" with Maples.

He reportedly refused to say anything more than: ""Marla's a good girl but I wanted out.""

The duo separated in 1997 and finally divorced in 1999.

Since the pair went their separate ways, Marla has released a musical journey of spiritual awakening album called The Endless featuring thoughts from the Dalai Lama and Deepak Chopra.

She also wrote a book called All That Glitters Is Not Gold but was cancelled before publishing.

Talking about her marriage, Marla said: ""We were so different. It could get a little bit combative.

""You always hope in a marriage that you bring out the best in each other but after many years we realised that we weren't.

""Girls in their 20s often want to change the men they're with. Make them a little softer.

""I had my own thoughts and views though.""

Marla was given only $2m (£1.63m) in the divorce and has not married again since.

Her current net worth $30m (£24m).

She joined Ivana in attending Donald's presidential inauguration in January.","dramatic"

ET and the X-Files have led us to see aliens as small green creatures with big googly eyes.

This comes as a George W. Bush finally opened up about classified UFO files.

But Dr Brian Choo, from the School of Biological Sciences at Flinders University in Australia, is hoping to change that perception.

He has come up with a logical explanation for what a plant and creature might look like on red dwarf planets – which could support life.

Working with artist Steven Grice, they have come up with some sensational 3D images.

Alien life would be amphibian and able to survive in barren conditions were there are not many plants – according to Dr Choo.

They have a protective shell on their back to block out the harsh sun’s heat and strong front legs to dig into the dirt to find food.

It also has a mouth beneath its head to eat plants on the surface of the planet and transparent skin to capture light for energy.

Dr Choo said: “This odd creature grazes on low growing lichen-like vegetation and digs for buried tubers.

“The low-slung body and armoured carapace permit it to forage during the blistering windstorms that scour surface.

“The paddle-like tail and vestigial fins betray an aquatic larval stage in the cool lakes at the edge of the melting dark-zone glaciers.”

While the plant has a propellor on top to help catch the wind to make it fly long distances to disperse its seed – Dr Choo believes.

Similar to a cactus, it has to store water for prolonged periods of time.

Dr Choo described the plant, saying: “Harsh surface conditions could drive plants underground. Like mushrooms, most of its anatomy may be out of sight – protected from the winds, heat and radiation.”

He added: “The fleshy body of this ‘plant’ is mostly underground, save for the spectacular rosette of petals that trap moisture and, with the aid of symbiotic microbes, harness sunlight.

“While the mature organism is immobile and unthinking, its wind-blown seeds possess the limited degree of self-awareness necessary to navigate it to a site suitable for germination.”","dramatic"

Geoghegan, who led the trio, launches a hammer to smash the front window before Molotov cocktails were dashed into the house at midnight.

But, the raid was not a complete success for the thugs as the footage appears to show one of the firebombs exploding prematurely in the garden next door.

It also appears that another gang member was struggling to light their firebomb.

The attack happened at 12.20am on October 21 last year.

Cops say the gang attacked the man renting the house as part of an ongoing drugs feud.

Geoghegan was convicted of arson reckless as to life was endangered following a one-day trial.

But the 28-year-old was cleared of the more serious charge of arson with intent to endanger life.

Wearing a hoodie and cap, Geoghegan throws a hammer at the front bay window but it rebounds from the glass.

He reaches down to pick the hammer - but at that moment there is a bright flash as the Molotov cocktail held by the other man explodes.

But the drugs enforcer carries on with the raid, throwing the hammer a second time and this time smashing the window.

He then urges the woman to throw her firebomb but she appears unable to light it.

The flames from the first firebomb never took hold and the gang drove away in cars.

The house was rented at the time by a man called Jai Turner who was away. He has since left the address.

Geoghegan tried to fool the jury by saying he was paid £100 by his drug dealer only to break a window and knew nothing about any planned firebomb attack.

Prosecutor Ed Bailey read a statement from the single mum living with her two young sons in the house next door - whom the police have asked not to identify.

Stunned archaeologists surveying the damage on the outskirts of Mosul have discovered the ancient underground palace of Assyrian King Sennacherib.

Until now, the 600BC palace lay undiscovered and untouched beneath the Tomb of the Prophet Jonah.

But now experts documenting the ruins have discovered “the treasure-house of the world’s first great empire”.

Iraqi forces crushed Daesh militants to recapture the region on the outskirts of Mosul last month.

After storming the region in 2014, jihadists caused extensive damage to an ancient shrine called The Nebi Yunus.

The shrine was blown to smithereens during the siege which saw ISIS claim large swathes of northern Iraq.

But it appears ISIS militants inadvertently opened a tunnel to the palace while burrowing for ancient artefacts to plunder.

Researchers believe ISIS were looking to sell the priceless artefacts on the black market to fund their ongoing war.

In one tunnel archaeologists found the remarkable marble cuneiform inscription of King Esarhaddon of the Assyrian empire, who ruled from 681 to 669 BC.

In 681-669 BC Esarhaddon renovated the palace, which was originally built by his father Sennacherib.

The palace was partially destroyed during the Sack of Nineveh in 612 BC.

Prof Eleanor Robson, chair of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq, was stunned by the stone sculptures, coins, jewelry and mosaics found in the palace.

She said: “The objects don’t match descriptions of what we thought was down there, so Isil’s destruction has actually led us to a fantastic find.

“There’s a huge amount of history down there, not just ornamental stones. It is an opportunity to finally map the treasure-house of the world’s first great empire, from the period of its greatest success.”

Ms Salih, a former curator of the Mosul museum, believes ISIS may have looted hundreds of objects.

He said: “I can only imagine how much Daesh discovered down there before we got here.

“We believe they took many of the artefacts, such as pottery and smaller pieces, away to sell. But what they left will be studied and will add a lot to our knowledge of the period.""

He said: ""At the moment the death is a mystery and we won't know the reason until there has been a proper investigation.

He said: ""It's on Shaq. He has to figure things out in his own camp.

""Maybe he is just too scared to show up because he's too busy riding around singing karaoke with John Cena and going to Krispy Kreme and getting fatter every week.”

While on speaking on ESPN, he added: """"He's got to be what, 440, 450 pounds?

""He's gotten pretty fat. Me on the other hand? I just weighed in this morning -- 379 pounds.""

""Maybe he doesn't want to put on spandex and show the entire world that Shaquille O'Neal, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, looks like Jabba the Hutt.”

""It's on him. He has to weigh these consequences in his own mind.

""Does he want the world to know how fat and out of shape he is? Or does he want to sit back and talk s--- into a podcast?""

Last week, O’Neal said on The Big Podcast with Shaq: ""It’s not going to happen? That’s probably right. It’s not my fault, that’s all you need to know. It ain’t my fault.

""It’s not totally off yet but it’s not looking good. But it doesn’t matter, I’m still working out and I still look better than Big Show.

""I’ll still meet him wherever he wants to meet me. These next thirty days, I’m about to go hard. I’m still doing it like it’s going down.”

Big Show showed off his workout pictures on Instagram – showing an amazing transformation from doughy giant to ripped monster.

Wrestlemania 33 will be taking over the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida, on April 2.

So far the company has announced only two matches for the blockbuster show – amid rumours of legends such as the Hardy Boyz making comebacks to the WWE.

Bray Wyatt will be defending his WWE Championship against either AJ Styles or Luke Harper, while Brock Lesnar will be facing off against Bill Goldberg.","dramatic"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/593830/Google-Chrome-update-malware-issue-web-browser","Use Google Chrome? Why you must update your web browser IMMEDIATELY","Google Chrome is, without doubt, the world's most popular web browser.

However, this popularity makes it a major target for cyber thieves trying to steal personal data from its millions of users.

Attacks on Chrome aren't anything new but a threat discovered last month was one of the worst to date.

It was found that cyber thieves were tricking Gmail and Chrome users into clicking on a fake login that then allowed personal data to be stolen.

The scam looked so real many were duped in to tapping on the link which then gave the attackers access to private details.

The scam was detected by Wordfence, which revealed just how it worked in a blog post on its website.

According to Wordfence, victims were targeted via an email to their Gmail account.

This fake message, which in some cases appeared to come from a known contact, included an attachment or image which enticed users to click on it.

Once tapped, this opened a new tab with a page which closely resembles the real Gmail login page, and asks the user to sign in once more.

However the page is actually a portal for hackers to steal your email address and password information - giving them full access to your account.

The hackers can then spread their virus even further by sending emails to all of your contacts.

And even worse, if you use the same login details for other websites or accounts, the hackers will be able to gain access to these to.

However, it now seems the threat has been fixed by Google in recent update to Chrome.

In a recent post by Wordfence, the company revealed ""Chrome has resolved this issue to my satisfaction. Earlier this month they released Chrome 56.0.2924 which changes the location bar behavior.

""If you now view a data URL, the location bar shows a “Not Secure” message which should help users realize that they should not trust forms presented to them via a data URL.

""It will help prevent this specific phishing technique.""

All users of Google Chrome should make sure their browser is up-to-date to stop any similar attacks on their computers.

The news comes as another big update for Chrome is being tested and could arrive soon.

This latest beta version of the hugely popular software is thought to include support for Apple's clever Touch Bar.

This Touch Bar was launched on Apple's new MacBook Pro late last year.

Because the bar is actually a clever Retina display it’s able to change its appearance depending on what applications you’re using on the screen.

However, Google's Chrome currently doesn't support the Touch Bar meaning the screen goes blank when using the software.

The update should mean, in the future, MacBook Pro users will get a range of extra features appear in the bar.

Apple's Safari browser, which already includes Touch Bar support, allows users to get fast access to the web search tool, favourites and the ability to instantly switch between open web pages.

It's currently unclear when the Chrome update will be available for the Mac Book Pro but, with it already being tested, users could see it arrive soon.","geeky"

The Galaxy S8 looks set to get its grand unveiling on March 29th at major Unpacked event and this could be the greatest phone the world has ever seen.

With a giant curved AMOLED display, superfast processor, upgraded camera and water resistant design there's plenty of new features to get excited about.

However, with all these shiny new upgrades the Galaxy S8 is not going to be cheap.

Contract prices will no doubt start at over £45 per month and a Galaxy S8 SIM free looks set to cost in excess of £650.

Luckily, there is some good news.

With the impending launch of the S8, Samsung has begun slashing the price of last year's S7 Edge.

Samsung announced recently that the S7 Edge was now available in Blue Coral at a lower price.

This means fans of the award-winning phone can grab one for under £600, with Argos and Amazon also offering incredible deals on this device.

And now there's another offer available to buyers.

From now until the end of March, Tesco Mobile is giving away a free gift worth up to £349 to anyone who buys a Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge handset.

The deal is available on both pay as you go and pay monthly contracts which start from just £31.50 per month.

Here's the free gifts that owners can choose from:

• Budding photographers can choose the Samsung Gear 360 to create VR photos and videos - worth £349

• Fitness fanatics can track their health stats even more precisely, by choosing the Samsung Gear Fit 2 - worth £179

• Music lovers can enjoy tunes at top of the range quality, by choosing the stylish Samsung Icon X Bluetooth Headphones - worth £199

The offer ends on 26th March 2017, and customers have until 24th May to redeem their free gift.

To do so, customers can head to samsungpromotions.claims/S7gifts and refer to their printed receipt or proof of purchase, to enter their details.

The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were launched early last year and feature Quad HD displays, waterproof design and a dual pixel camera.

Both devices received rave reviews and the Galaxy S7 Edge was crowned best smartphone of the year at numerous award ceremonies.

So is now a good time to buy this device?

With a price cut from Samsung and deals on offer from firm's including Tesco and Carphone Warehouse, it's certainly the cheapest time to grab an S7.

It's also a very good handset but it will be eclipsed in a few weeks time when the S8 is finally revealed.","geeky"

That’s according to the company’s SVP of hardware, Rick Osterloh, who revealed the big news during a press event at Mobile World Congress earlier this week.

The company is set to reveal the Google Pixel 2 later this year and will remain a “premium” device.

“There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh commented.

“You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.”

Rumours of the Google Pixel 2 first emerged earlier this year, with the device expected to feature a number of hardware improvements on the first-generation device.

This will include a more powerful processor, as well as more memory and storage. It’s rumored that Google is carrying out several tests at the moment with different processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and specialised Intel hardware.

Despite the latest update, Google is set to feature renewed smartphone competition in the coming weeks, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 both set to launch in the not too distant future.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is still weeks away, but now a major new leak has revealed everything you could want to know about the new phone.

Having already been the subject of multiple leaks and countless rumours, the entire Galaxy S8 specs sheet has now emerged online.

Revealing all the inner workings of the upcoming iPhone rival, the leaked specs sheets has confirmed the eagerly awaited handset is going to be something truly special.

Surfaced via tech blog TechnoBuffalo, the comprehensive Galaxy S8 leak also shows how similar the phone will be to the Galaxy S8+, with the larger phone having seen its full features list emerge earlier this week.

Kicking things off with the screen, the S8 looks set to be a visual delight with a 5.8-inch QHD panel set to boast a stunning 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution.

This panel will curve around both the phone's left and right hand edges and will be squeezed in to a phone with near identical dimensions to last year's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 thanks to a new edge-to-edge design made possible by killing off the
physical home button on the phone's lower front edge.

Elsewhere the phone, which like its predecessor will be water and dust resistant, will play host to a 12MP dual pixel primary camera and a new 8-megapixel selfie shooter that'll be enhanced by its own integrated flash.

That's not all the front camera will be capable of, either.

Partnered with a new iris scanner, the phone will be capable of being unlocked just by looking at it, with the camera helping read the unique pattern within your eye.","geeky"

But it is his fairytale romance with Rachael Roberts that helps keep him grounded.

Rachael and the Bomber first met when the boxing champ was just nine years old and they have dated since they were teens.

The boxer openly admits she is the one person who scares him, and is credited for keeping the fighter on the right path.

The 34-year-old said: ""I fear no man but I wouldn't f**king cross her.”

Rachael is the mother to the champs three children Corey, Cobey and Carter.

While she was not at last night’s incredible fight, she was at his side when he picked up the WBC Cruiserweight Championship.

Bellew had packed the family off to Dubai and banned his kids from social media in the build-up to the brutal match.

The couple have one of the longest standing relationships in boxing and she has helped keep Bellew grounded as he smashed his way to the top of the sport.

Last night's fight was so brutal, it left Haye in hospital with a suspected achilles injury.

Bellew said Rachael would be the reason he won’t splashing the cash after picking up a seven-figure pay-day for the Haye fight.

""I would fight any man. I tell you what though, I don’t go home to her with a penny short,"" he said.

Bellew also admitted she is the reason why he won’t buy a Rolls Royce Wraith – despite really wanting one.

He said: “I won’t even lease one. Do you know why? I’m not earning for me. I stopped earning for me when my first kid was born. I’m banking it for them.

""Believe you me, I’m banking it.""

He added: “We’ve got a lovely house that is basically paid for. I have an 11-year-old and an 8-year-old with two vehicles in the driveway. Quad bikes.""

She is normally seen roaring with support for her man – and even got into a shouting match with Haye when Bellew was facing BJ Flores last year.

Before the fight he said his first priority was to be back home in Liverpool with the family when they arrive home from Dubai.","dramatic"

In a bid to find out which whiffs men find sexually arousing, researchers at the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago studied 31 guys between the ages of 18 and 64.

The men were hooked up to a plethysmograph, a machine that measures blood flow caused by sexual arousal, and asked to breathe 24 different fragrances through various masks.

Researchers found that sniffing pumpkin pie was the most powerful turn on, particularly when mixed with the fragrance of lavender, with 40% of the men being aroused by that smell.

Alan Hirsch, Director of Chicago's Smell and Taste Treatment Research Foundation, revealed that the aroma of pumpkin pie “increased the men's penile blood flow by an average of 40%” while also reducing anxiety.

He told WBPF: ""Throw away the perfume and go get some pumpkin pie.

“The number one odour that enhanced penile blood flow was a combination of lavender and pumpkin pie.”

But why is sniffing pumpkin so sexy?

Researchers believe that “the odours could induce a Pavlovian conditioned response reminding partners of sexual partners or their favourite foods”.

Interestingly all of the scents in the study stimulated guys’ sexual responses in some way or another.

Alan added: ""Nothing turns a man… off.""

Men may get hot from sniffing things, but some women instantly orgasm when they hear a certain sound.

How’s this for an option: Ask a man to come round, watch you have sex with each other, and then give his “expert opinion” on what you should and shouldn’t be doing.

If that sounds up your alley, meet Kenneth Play, sex coach.

Kenneth told the Independent he came in to this line of work two years ago and has coached more than 50 couples around the world.

Kenneth said he used to limit it to swingers events and sex parties, however was inspired to start his “private play lab” and begin home visits after he realised not everyone is comfortable in a group setting.

“Some people want to have more discretion and privacy and want individual attention. Since I came from a decade and a half of personal training, I knew how to do sessions in a one-on-one setup, although these are really one-on-two,” Kenneth explained.

“We craft out things we're going to try in the first play session. In that first part, I do a lot of show and tell and teaching. They try out and practice a bunch of things with live coaching from me; I coach on energy both and technique.”

After a break – including a snack and a debrief session – Kenneth watches the couple resume round two and gives them a half hour debrief after.

“I work with a lot of different clients. Some of them are referrals from therapists who don't do hands-on education,” Kenneth said.

“Often, couples who have been together for a long time will fall into a certain sex pattern, and if the pattern stops working for them, they have less sex.”

Kenneth added he aims to make education as accessible as porn and his educational sessions last around four hours in total.

A time which Kenneth said takes a “lot of time and energy”. Hence the hefty price tag.

Kenneth said the biggest recurring issue he sees between couples is lack of communication.

""Most couples don't know how to communicate with each other; they don't have the language or communication skills or practice. It's more challenging for them to try new things. My expertise fills in the gaps for them.”","vulgar"

In fact, some estimates place 20 million devices in use in the UK right now and this number is increasing by the day.

These set-top devices allow users to access a host of online content including services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

The Kodi box and software itself is perfectly legal, however, because it's an open platform, it does allow users to install additional applications that allow them to access copyrighted material – uploaded, shared or streamed from other users across the globe.

These include the lastest blockbuster movies, TV shows and premium sports channels.

These ""Fully loaded"" boxes are clearly illegal and it now seems their popularity is causing concern for the UK authorities.

The Intellectual Property Office is now involved in trying to put a stop to the sale and use of these devices,

And the IPO has called a consultation where it is asking for help from a number of groups with experience of investigating and prosecuting offences related to these streaming devices.

In a post about its consultation about Kodi Boxes, the IPO said: “Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) boxes (also known as set-top boxes, Android TV boxes or Kodi boxes) are small plug and play media servers, originally designed to allow consumers to stream legitimate content (locally stored or legal online content).

“Despite the legitimate use of this equipment, software is widely available (illicit Kodi extensions being the best known) which connect the boxes to illegal content through streaming websites, file lockers and BitTorrent trackers.”

According to the UK Intellectual Property Office, the sale of cheap, ""Fully Loaded"", Kodi boxes has triggered to a sharp increase in use from consumers.

Obviously this rapid growth has riled copyright owners and those whose business relies on the official, paid-for distribution of copyrighted content.

“Broadcasters and content owners have voiced concerns that, although a range of existing legislation applies to the sale and use of these devices (as well as the provision of illicit content streams), the legal framework does not provide sufficient tools to tackle this growing threat,” the IPO adds.

Technology site TorrentFreak reports that, from the information made available by the Intellectual Property Office so far, it seems likely the UK government will tighten-up a number of strands of legislation that could be applied to these devices, including their advertising, sale, supply, and use at home.

The consultation will close on April 7th 2017.

The news comes after five people accused of selling illegally modified versions of the popular set-top boxes were taken into custody last month.

The arrests surround a number of ""fully loaded Kodi boxes"" that have popped up, with the unlawful devices breaking international copyright rules.

Kieron Sharp, director general of Fact, said: ""These arrest should send out a clear warning to anyone involved in the sale and distribution of illegal set-top boxes.

""Set-top boxes loaded with apps and add-ons allowing access to copyright infringing material are very much illegal and anyone involved in selling these boxes should not be surprised to receive a knock on the door.""","geeky"

In one of the snaps, a man leers down at her boobs as she reveals her assets to passing bystanders.

It was revealed that the Met has allowed Frost's wife to continue to work as a prostitute after he approached them about the issue.

She is known online as Busty Sarah Jane and tours the country ­charging up to ￡130 an hour for sex sessions.

The lass is said to have bragged about making hundreds of graphic porn movies, ­including one ­involving 40 men.

Sarah Jane proudly boasts of having a 36G bust and says on an adult website: “I love sex and I love meeting new people.

“I’m fun, friendly and my cheeky smile and natural curvy figure will put you at ease in no time.

“I am up for most things and love to be adventurous, so if there is something you would like to try just ask.”

PC Frost, 41, a safer schools ­officer, confirmed his wife is a sex worker.

He told the Mirror: “I know about it, friends know about it, family know about it.

""My bosses are completely and utterly aware of it and have said there’s no conflict of interest. There’s no problem.

“If there was a problem, I wouldn’t have a job, would I?”

Dark-haired Sarah Jane has lived in Kent with PC Frost since they got married in August 2015.

Prostitution is legal in England and Wales.

But soliciting in public, kerb crawling, pimping and owning or managing a ­brothel are illegal.

PC Frost, who has been in the Met for 15 years and works in Southwark, South London, continued: “The police have been involved in all this.

“I’ve been working with the police since the beginning and spoken to the Directorate of Professional Standards. I was completely checked out.

“They said it was OK because I’m not involved in her industry.

“There’s no kickback between my ­private and professional life and no crossover ­between the two.

""This is what the police are ­saying. Sarah doesn’t do anything with me and the police and vice versa.”

The Met confirmed it knew PC Frost’s wife was a working prostitute.

South Korea is now ramping up action to tackle their northern neighbours with a plan set to be agreed by the Ministry of Unification.

Seoul officials plan to offer a massive bounty for defectors who can provide information about the reclusive government in Pyongyang.

Traitors who swap sides to the South would be offered a reward of up to 1 billon won – £700,000 – if they have classified information on North Korea.

Defectors are already offered 250 million won so the reward is primed to increase four-fold as the threat rises from Kim Jong-un.

North Korea's elite who work closely with Kim or on the nuclear missile programme will be offered the biggest cash prizes.

""One of the biggest reasons why North Koreans are hesitant about defecting is because they are fearful of making a living after they come to South Korea,"" a source in Seoul told Yonhap.

""The increase reflects the rise in consumer prices since 1997 when the last reward money adjustment was made"".

Rewards are offered for those who have information on the regime, and the big cash rewards are presented to those who bring military equipment such as planes or ships with them.

“Al Qaida remain a threat and there are offshoots of both organisations. The military success is welcome but in and of itself it's not going to eradicate the terrorist problem.”

He went on: “We are not seeing the same number travelling out there that we were a couple of years ago.

“There are still cases where people do look to travel but they are a smaller number.

“People travelling out there is a part of our work, the prospect of people travelling back is a part, but the majority of it is actually people in this country who are radicalised.

“Sometimes they are in contact with people overseas and they are looking to radicalise others in this country and potentially conduct attacks. Most of our work is centred here.”

Cops have had extra work on their hands in the last few months as the threat of far-right extremism reemerges.

Mr Rowley added: “It would be wrong to suggest it was of the same gravity as the threat from Daesh and al Qaida, but there are extreme right-wing groups who are trying to provoke violence in communities, trying to sow discord and divide communities and on occasion using violence.”

The 48-year-old got her first boob job back in 2004, after her 48-year-old partner Dave joked that her 36AA boobs made her look masculine.

But Janey has suffered disaster after disaster with her boobs – claiming they were left botched after a number of surgeries went wrong.

She says all she has to show for it is scarring and swelling, leaving her feeling too disgusted to look in the mirror.

Janey, who works as an office manager, said: ""When I was younger, I was a double A cup and had no boobs at all.

""I did struggle with it growing up – I felt very boyish and lacked self-confidence.

""But I never really considered having a boob job, because I was scared at the thought of surgery.""

It wasn’t until the comment from her husband that Janey was spurred on to go under the knife.

She continued: “One day, Dave was stood behind me in the mirror - he put his hands on my breasts and said: ‘You look like a man.’

""I know Dave has always been a bit of a boob man, but it wasn't something he'd brought up before - I was shocked.

""I was absolutely gutted, I was so, so upset by it. It made me feel so unattractive and manly – if I wore a dress I felt like a man in drag.

""Dave even sold his BMW for £4,000 to get the money for it.""

After being affected by the PIP scandal in 2012, her implants were replaced with something Janey claims left her breasts tight and painful.

The brunette babe reckons that surgeons replaced them with the wrong sized implants, before she finally got a size she was happy with.

After discovering her boobs were wonky six months ago, her surgeon suggested she should have an uplift – and when she went under the knife last month, he discovered her implants had ruptured.

Now Janey has been left with no implants and in agonising pain while her body recovers.

Initially Janey had no problems with her implants, which had taken her from a AA to a B cup – despite her reservations, she felt great and it boosted her confidence.

But when the PIP scandal broke out, she went to get her implants checked and discovered they needed to be replaced.

She said: ""I just wanted to get them replaced, but the surgeon said I'd need an uplift too. I didn't want that, because it meant scarring.

""In the end I had to go ahead with it, because the surgeon refused to do it without an uplift too – and that cost another £5,000.

""But after the surgery, I just didn't feel right. I couldn't move my arms properly and I was in agony.

""The implants were too big and too tight, they'd taken me to an E cup which I never wanted.

""They were droopy and felt like big, heavy weights on my body. Every day I was in pain - it was so depressing.""

Eventually Janey went to a different surgeon who agreed they needed loosening and she booked an appointment to have the implants replaced again - at a cost of £4,500.

But despite agreeing on D cups, Janey claims she was mistakenly given whopping F cups which she said were ""horrendous"" and made her feel like a glamour model.

So in 2015, Janey went to yet another surgeon and booked in to have a boob reduction to a D cup and an uplift and she forked out another £5,500.

She said: ""This surgeon was great – he understood my problem completely.

""He said he could sort it and replace them with smaller implants, but he said I would need another uplift. He said: ’It's a wonder they haven't dropped off by now.’

""He did a perfect job and I was so happy with the result.""

But as time went on, Janey started to notice her boobs becoming wonky and six months ago, her sister commented on it too.

She said: ""I went back to my surgeon, and he agreed that my right breast was about two centimetres higher than my left breast.

""He said: ‘Perhaps implants don't suit you, why don't you have them out?'

""The doctor said I'd have droopy, saggy skin where the implants had been, so he said he'd do another uplift.""

But when Janey came round from the surgery, she was horrified to find out that the old implants had ruptured inside her.

The faulty implants have now been sent back to the manufacturer for testing.

Janey, who is now back to a B cup, added: ""Boob jobs have ruined my life and I wish I'd never had it done to begin with.

""To Dave, saying I looked like a man might have been a throw away comment, which he says he doesn't remember, but it stuck with me and kick started 13 years of hell - it's been one drama after another.

""I don't blame Dave for any of this, I know he loves me and wants me to be happy.

""Without Dave's support I wouldn't have been able to have additional surgery to correct any of the issues, as he sorted all the loans – it's not his fault.

Alvaro Jimenez Gonzalez was trying to switch off footage of a woman using a sex toy when he lost his footing and plummeted to the ground below.

Computer hackers swapped advertisements for explicit images on the massive television in the middle of a city centre.

Firefighters were called amidst fears that motorists on a nearby motorway would be distracted from the road by the smutty video.

The company who own the advertising board apologised to anyone who had seen the video after it began playing on a loop in Mexico city.

A spokesman for billboard owners Carteleras.com, said: ""We know the discomfort of this to passersby, drivers and society in general.

""Therefore we are investigating the case with authorities.""

The video began playing in the middle of the day after hackers targeted the screen, located in the San Antonio area of the Mexican capital.

Drivers on the nearby Periferico Sur motorway were surprised to see the revealing images of a woman writhing with a sex toy between her legs.

One motorist used his mobile phone to record the giant advertisement panel as it displayed the pornographic material.

The footage went viral on social media networks and the authorities scrambled to turn off the screen.

The director of the fire brigade, Raul Esquivel, confirmed that a fireman had died.

He said: ""We regret the death of our pal Alvaro Jimenez Gonzalez from the fire brigade.

""All the support of our institution and of the government of Mexico will go to the family of our friend.""

The authorities have asked owners of this kind of advertisement to improve their security measures in order to avoid a repeat of the porn hacking.

It is not the first time that hackers have targeted billboards in Mexico with pornography.

In February this year, the ""menu"" of a porn website was seen on an advertising board on the same motorway.

But because the hack took place at midnight, it is thought that fewer people witnessed it before it was removed.","dramatic"

Reverse engineered from Soviet technology, the huge vessel is primed to be one of the devastating pieces in play as tensions boil with the US.

The ship is believed to be christened the Shandong and will be stationed in the South China Sea.

It is China's first ever ""homegrown"" aircraft carrier – being built from the ground-up by Beijing.

China are believed to be plotting to construct up to six aircraft carriers to ensure total dominance in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Shandong will be one of biggest warships afloat in the world – but it is just the tip of the iceberg for China.

The carrier is primed to be the beginning of huge military programme embarked on by Beijing.

Today, Communist Party-linked state media released a promotional package revealing the mega vessel to the Chinese people.

“Its design, combat capability and technologies will be much more advanced,” Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping said.

Project 001A was a state-secret, and it was not common knowledge satellite photos of its construction emerged in 2015.

Work is already underway on top secret project 002 – which is believed to be much larger, nuclear powered and on-par with the battle ready carriers in the US Navy.

China's current and sole aircraft carrier –originally named the Varyag – was purchased in 1998 under the guise of being converted into floating casino.

Last year, the rechristened Liaoning plunged through the South China Sea in a show of strength to the US.

The vessel is actually the sister ship of Vladimir Putin's favourite warship Russia's aircraft carrier the Admiral Kuznetsov – which plunged through the English Channel in October.

However, the US Navy still represent the world's supreme sea power – with 10 full-size aircraft carriers in the fleet.

“In order to protect China’s territories and overseas interests, China needs two carrier strike groups in the West Pacific Ocean and two in the Indian Ocean. So we need at least five to six aircraft carriers,” a reported state-run newspaper The Global Times.

Project 001A is expected to be launched within weeks – but it is not expected to be in full active service until 2019.

Diggers expect to dig down up to eight metres over a period of six to ten weeks in the hunt for the 23-year-old gunner.

The RAF man’s phone was last tracked to a nearby position over five months ago, and cops think he could still be there.

Today a truck and digger could be seen moving debris at the site while workmen helped.

It comes after cops arrested Hayden Stephens, 26, on suspicion of perverting the court of justice.

He works as a traffic dispatcher for Biffa waste management and has been bailed until next month.

A bin lorry was spotted collecting rubbish from an area in St Edmunds where Corrie was last seen following a night out drinking with pals.

CCTV caught Corrie’s last sighting as he walked into an area known as the Horseshoe at around 3.25am on September 24.

Waste was collected from the area just hours later and its route appeared to match up with the movements on Corrie’s phone.

But forensics found no trace of Corrie’s DNA in the waste truck.

Detective Superintendent Katie Elliott of Suffolk Police said: ""One of these lines of enquiry has been in respect of waste collections from the area, known as the horseshoe, around the time of the last sighting of Corrie.”

Corrie’s dad Martin McKeague and his wife Trisha have travelled to the landfill site as the search is conducted.

Martin, a former bin man himself, says he is terrified by the idea that his son might have been in the lorry.

He said: ""I worked in the refuse and recycling industry and find it hard to figure out how Corrie could have been missed if he was in one of those bins.

""I know all about what happens to the contents of a bin when it is tipped into the lorry, what happens to make the rubbish more compressed in the back of the truck and how it is emptied at a landfill holding site.

""It's haunting to think Corrie may have been in one of those bins, what may have happened.""

Corrie’s mother Nicola Urquhart, 48, has previously admitted there’s a good “possibility” her son’s body would be found at the site.

She also appealed for anyone who knows anything about his disappearance to come forward.

""At least give us some more closure, not just finding Corrie, but also how he got there and what happened to him,” she pleaded.

Corrie, originally from Fife in Scotland, has sparked a massive public search since his disappearance.

Since he mysteriously vanished it has emerged that his girlfriend April Oliver, 21, is pregnant with his child.","dramatic"

And despite owning a fleet of top-of-the-range Audi and Mercedes cars, the £290,000-a-week Frenchman has submitted plans to convert his current garage into a gym and build another home for his motors nearby.

According to Trafford Council planning documents, the new garage ""will provide parking for two vehicles and the amended drive way will provide hard standing for two vehicles"".

Midfielder Pogba saved himself a fortnight's wages by netting the swanky home for £600,000 under the £3.49m asking price.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/594058/Increase-libido-boost-sex-drive-women-female","Four strange ways to turn her on – without touching her","You might be shocked to find out that 50% of women suffer from sexual problems like a lack of libido, a loss of arousal and not being able to orgasm.

But the key to boosting her bedroom desire could be weirder than you first thought.

If you want to get her in the mood, maybe it’s time to stop shaving or let her get some shut eye.

Here are some surprising ways to turn her on without touching her.

1. Stubble

Stop worrying about brains and personality because there’s one physical feature women just can’t resist – facial hair.

Men who want to attract a mate should wave goodbye to shaving because a new study suggests that women can’t resist some face fuzz.

Research published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour found that lads should ditch their razors for a fortnight – because 10-day-old stubble was the sexiest.

2. Sleep

If she’s not in the mood for a tumble between the sheets, it could be because she simply hasn’t had enough time in bed.

Spending more time in the sack – sleeping – is the key to a healthier sex life, according to science.

A good night’s sleep can boost a woman’s sex drive, so let her catch a few extra winks to increase her libido later on.

Recent research from the University of Michigan tracked 171 ladies’ sleeping patterns and sex drives for two weeks.

When women had more shut-eye they said they felt more turned on the next day, with those in relationships reporting feeling particularly horny.

Coupled-up ladies who spent an extra hour dozing in the sack were 14% more likely to have sex the next day.

The well-rested women enjoyed getting down and dirty more, as well as feeling better genital arousal, compared to those who hadn’t slept for as long.

3. Vanity

Contrary to popular belief, what women really want is a man who’s vain and self-absorbed (apparently).

Lads who find themselves attractive are also attractive to other people, no doubt because of their confident, smooth and charming personalities.

According to a new speed-dating study from the University of Graz in Austria, narcissistic guys who love themselves have more sexual partners.

Researchers found that bad boys with a “dark triad” of personality traits got laid more often.

The three traits are narcissism (self-love), Machiavellianism (coldness and manipulation) and psychopathy (anti-social behaviours like being impulsive, selfish and remorseless).

4. Petrol

Rev up the engine and drive down to the petrol station because British women are turned on by the smell of gasoline.

According to a study by Daz laundry detergent, ladies were also aroused by scents of leather, paint and printer ink.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/594038/Sex-tips-how-to-make-her-orgasm-foreplay","Three easy sex tips that guarantee her an orgasm – every single time","Unsurprisingly men find it easier to reach orgasm than women. In fact 91% of men reach the big-O while having sex compared to just 64% of women, according to the National Survey of Sex and Behaviour.

Interestingly, men said that their female partners reached climax 85% of the time, which can mean only one thing – they're faking it.

But how can you guarantee she reaches the big-O?

There are several ways you can increase her chances of climax, here are the top three:

1. Keep it simple

You might think you have to do all kinds of imaginative things to get her off, but our recent study proves otherwise.

We asked our readers “which sex act do you orgasm from most”. The poll of 9,360 women revealed vaginal sex was the most common way to make her orgasm, with 36% of the vote.

Oral sex came in second with 26% saying they climaxed when receiving it. And 24% said they orgasmed through mutual masturbation.

Only 14% said the sex act they orgasmed from most was anal sex, despite another study saying this was the best way to increase her pleasure.

2. Let her take charge

It’s important to put the effort in when it’s needed, but you should also let her take charge sometimes.

This is particularly important because the sex position which garners the most orgasms is Girl On Top.

Other pleasurable positions include Spooning and Doggy Style, which has been voted Britain’s favourite sex position.

3. Don’t forgo foreplay

We recently conducted a survey asking simply “what makes someone good in bed?”

Possible answers included things like “stamina” and “penis size”, but there was one overriding winner – foreplay.

A whopping 36% of the 4,994 people you took part said foreplay was the most important factor when it came to sex.

This was closely followed by “make sure we both orgasm”, which ad 33% of the votes.

Comparatively, only 13% said having a big penis was the key to being a good lover.","vulgar"

He pleaded guilty at Colchester Military Court Centre, Essex, to improper use of a public communication network.

Assistant judge advocate Judge Robert Hill sentenced Saunders to 28 days’ detention, reducing it to 24 after his early guilty plea.

Filmed on safari in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, the clip begins with the smaller buffalo running from its much larger rival.

But when the buffalo realises he will not be able to get away he has no choice but to face the elephant’s wrath head on.

But it turns out that may have been the wrong decision.

The elephant marches into the buffalo and horrifically stabs its tusk through the victim’s eye.

But he isn’t finished there.

The giant grey mammal picks its prey up with its tusk still stuck through the buffalo's head, sending it flying through the air.

And after all that the elephant crushes its victim, leaning its whole body weight on the animal to make sure it is killed.

It then retreats as the shocked tourists can do nothing but watch.

In the background of the clip, a man and woman can be heard shouting in horror, with one saying: “Ah no man what the hell! No man.”

Her companion replies: “God it’s terrible that. That’s the end of that buffalo.”

The incredible nature clip has been seen more than 8.3 million times on YouTube.

“This footage is amazing. Elephants are scary when angry,” one viewer wrote.

Another said: “That Elephant ran up on that buffalo like he owed him money.”

But just a day later, Higham brutally bludgeoned his newborn tot to death while the baby’s mother was out visiting a friend.

Test showed 16-day-old Florence Higham had suffered ""extensive injuries"" consistent with her being repeatedly punched and or slammed against a hard surface.

Matthew, from Liverpool, had a history of abusing alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis and had another child removed from his care due to his drug and alcohol abuse.

He had also previously been issued with a restraining order banning him from seeing the girl’s mother, Sharon Collins, after he headbutted her and bit her on the leg during an argument.

The inquest heard the visit to Miss Colllins' home took place on July 28 2015 just a fortnight after the baby was born with officials saying they were reducing their association with them due to a “decreased level of concern.”

Sharon Collins said: “If there was a problem I wouldn't have let him have her.

“There was a few times I was scared of him – it was his mouth, he was quite dirty in his words he would say some right vile things.”

Matthew Higham initially denied killing the tot, saying: “I'm not responsible for the death of my lovely little girl Florence.""

“She was the light of my eyes. I have not shook her or dropped her.”

But at Preston Crown Court in January 2016 Higham admitted murder and was jailed for life with a recommendation he serve 25 years.

She was found with fractures to her face and serious injuries to her neck after police stopped the vehicle she was driving in Mitchell – a rural town about 350 miles west of Brisbane, Queensland.

The man allegedly forced her to drive more than 600 miles around the state – occasionally stopping to rape and beat her.

Her alleged attacker – also 22 – was found in a storage alcove in the back of the 4x4.

Police pulled over the vehicle the woman was driving after she failed to pay at a petrol station.

She told officers she had been held captive by a man she had met at a party in Cairns, Queensland.

Officers say the woman met the man three months ago and they agreed to go on a road trip.

But it quickly turned into a violent nightmare.

They had been travelling around since January 2 – with the woman saying she was held against her will.

He had damaged her passport – possibly to prevent her escape – Queensland Police said.

Detective Inspector Paul Hart said: ""Police were really just attending a routine job in relation to a driver that was unable to pay for petrol.""

But they noticed she had various injuries and was ""overly alarmed"" by the officers' presence when they pulled her over in Warrego Highway.

Mr Hart continued: ""She advised that over a period of weeks she had been held against her will by the male person located in the vehicle.

""It was established they had previously had a relationship but at some point it had soured and he basically deprived her of her liberty and committed a number of offences against her as they travelled around the state.

""What she has experienced is no doubt horrific and terrifying and we commend her for taking the opportunity to speak to our police.

""We have potentially saved this young girl's life.

""Given what's happened to her, the extent of what's happened over the period of time, anything might have transpired.""

The woman and her alleged attacker had apparently been living in the 4x4 for eight weeks.

He made her drive around Queensland, stopping off in Gordenvale, in the far north, and Bowen, in the centre, before police stopped them in a routine traffic stop.

South-west Detective Inspector Paul Hart said: ""After police conducted a search of the vehicle it appeared evident that they had been living in the SUV for the past couple of weeks.""

The tourist, who police believe had been in the country since 2015, was treated in hospital for injuries which also included scratches and cuts to her neck and bruising to her body.

She has spoken to family in the UK but is unable to return while a new passport is arranged.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are supporting a British woman following an incident in Queensland and remain in contact with the local authorities.""

The man – from the Cairns suburb of Manunda – has already faced a court on charges, including four counts of rape, eight counts of assault, four counts of strangulation and two of deprivation of liberty.

He's also facing drug charges.

It's alleged he held the woman against her will and assaulted her at various locations across Queensland between January 2 and March 5.","dramatic"

Police forces up and down the country issued warnings as they dealt with dozens of reported incidents.

The trend, which originally started in America, seemed to die out just after Halloween.

But over the weekend police were called to reports of two men dressed as clowns chasing youngsters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The kids were playing hide and seek in the woods when they spotted the strange men.

Dylan Milkowski's dad Michael said his son came running into the house saying two men were chasing him.

He told CBS Local: ""I said to my kids ‘are you lying or something’ and they were like ‘no we’re being really serious.’

North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un fired four ballistic missiles that landed in the Sea of Japan on Sunday night.

But Pyongyang confirmed the test rockets were part off an exercise aiming for US military bases in Japanese territory.

North Korea’s state media, KCNA, reported: “Involved in the drill were Hwasong artillery units of the KPA Strategic Force tasked to strike the bases of the US imperialist aggressor forces in Japan in contingency.

“In the hearts of artillerymen...there was burning desire to mercilessly retaliate against the warmongers going ahead with their joint war exercises.""

But the Thaad deployment risks angering the China, which has said it sees any movement of military hardware by the US in the region as a direct threat.

It comes as Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reportedly told President Donald Trump that the threat from North Korea had “entered a new stage”.

Trump has previously described Kim Jong-un as a “big, big problem” and promised he will deal with the issue “very strongly”.

The UN Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting tomorrow to discuss what can be done to stop the threat from the secretive state.

And tensions have peaked in the region following the assassination of Kim Jong-un’s half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur airport.

As the row over his death deepens, North Korea has banned any Malaysian citizens in the country from leaving.

This affects nine people over there, including three diplomats.

McQuaid was defenceless to stop the blade from cutting his neck open after skating up behind teammate David Backes, who overbalanced and accidentally slashed the 30-year-old.

Incredibly, the Canadian remained on the ice for the next 20 seconds until a break in play, skating around while clutching a hand to his neck.

Bruins medical staff immediately tended to him after leaving the field of play, administering more than 25 stitches to the wound.

“I'm amazed he escaped death here,” wrote one fan.

“Seriously I didn’t see the incident until now but if you showed me the ‘after’ stitching – how the hell could they control the blood loss in the meantime?”

Vince, the rare five-year-old white rhinoceros, was found dead today at a zoo in Thoiry, west ofParis.

Raiders attacked the creature on Monday night and zoo keepers made the horrifying discovery this morning.

Vicious poachers shot the animal three times in the head and the horn was cut off with a chainsaw.

Horns from rhinos can fetch up to £180,000 on the black market.

Thoiry zoo

The animal is behind the very popular African Animal Park Reserve.

Cops believe one or more killers forced the back door of the zoo open.

“It is possible that the thieves did not have time to attack other animals,” a source told Le Parisien newspaper.

Authorities say this is the first time a rhino horn has been stolen in Europe and the first time an animal has been butchered by poachers in a French zoo.

Forensic teams have found evidence at the scene.

But the rhino hide is considered too thick to be able to know what type of weapon was used.

There are only around 21,000 white rhinos in the world today, and many were very angry at what had happened.

Park director Thierry Duguet said the murderous attack was “unbelievable”, adding: “Our fellow European park managers are astonished.”

Fears the Chancellor will punish diesel drivers in budget","Experts fear Phillip Hammond will bring a major change in policy to punish diesel drivers when the budget is revealed tomorrow.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has issued a warning over what it calls the government's ""anti-diesel agenda"".

New changes to road tax laws coming into force in April will see people buying low emission cars hit with an increased price hike.

And the changes could make your diesel car completely worthless by 2020.

Under the old system low emission car owners were exempt from paying road tax for life.

But from April, anyone buying an eco-friendly model will be forced to pay a yearly rate of £140.

New diesel car owners will also be hit with a road tax price hike, while electric and hydrogen will be exempt from the charge.

The UK now boasts Europe's largest market for zero emission cars, but the growth in alternatively fuelled vehicles (AVF) has slowed.

Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said: ""The automotive industry has some of the most challenging CO2 reduction targets of any sector and continues to deliver reductions as it has for nearly two decades.

""For this positive trend to continue, modern low emission diesels and AFVs such as plug-ins, hydrogen and hybrids must be encouraged with long term incentives.

""Turning our back on any of these will undermine progress on CO2 targets as well as air quality objectives.""

Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, predicts prices of diesel cars will fall dramatically over the next five years.

He told The Guardian: ""Will all diesels be worthless in five years? Most unlikely.

""Will some of them be worth significantly less than they otherwise might have been? Almost certainly.”

Combined with the ban on diesel vehicles in city centres such as London, it's feared the demand for motors will plummet over the next few years.

A number of cities, including Paris, Madrid and Athens, plan to take diesel cars off the road entirely by 2025.

While diesel produces 15% less CO2 than petrol, it actually emits far more nitrogen dioxide — a pollutant linked to serious health problems like Asthma.

London has one of the worst levels of NO2 pollution in the world, with many parts of the capital over the EU's illegal limits.","dramatic"

They orbit TRAPPIST-1, a dwarf star just 39 lightyears away, at what may be a habitable distance.

Within this habitable zone, planets are not too hot or cold to support water and thus life.

But the size of the habitable zone depends on how much hydrogen is held in the planets’ atmospheres.

So scientists are searching the planets for volcanoes, which spew out enough hydrogen to replace what’s lost to space.

Volcanic hydrogen can increase the size of the star’s habitable zone by 60%, massively raising the odds of alien life in space.

And since the insides of these planets may be heated up by the gravitational forces they bring to bear on each other, volcanism is likely.

Ramses Ramirez and Lisa Kaltenegger of Cornell University, in the US state of New York, examined the difference volcanoes make.

TRAPPIST-1h, the farthest of the seven planets from its star, lies just outside what’s believed to be the habitable zone.

But Dr Ramirez says it’s ""really close"" and, with volcanism, the planet may just hold on to life-giving liquid water.

""So long as volcanism is intense, it can outpace the rate at which hydrogen escapes into space,"" he said.","dramatic"

An inquest into the accident at Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire heard the plane crashed and burst into flames.

Eyewitness John Goodey, who was working at a car auction site next to the airfield, said: ""It flew over the fence, it was bouncing on all the roofs of the cars, the noise was horrendous.""

He said he could see wires sparking off the back of the aircraft before it exploded.

The hearing at Basingstoke Coroner's Court heard Jordanian pilot, 58-year-old Mazen Salim Alqasim, was a last-minute substitute for the flight.

Julian Firth, principal investigator of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), said that although the pilot had flown to Blackbushe previously, he might have been more used to flying into airports which are more tightly co-ordinated by air traffic controllers.

North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said: ""Blackbushe is not an all-singing, all-dancing airport and instructions from the control tower are not what you would get from Heathrow and Jeddah.

""He was approaching too fast, touching down at the wrong point, he's making a decision to continue with his landing until it's too late.""

Senior AAIB inspector Afandi Darlington said the Saudi-registered Phenom 300 jet approached the airfield at 151 kias (knots-indicated air speed), 40% faster than the target of 108 kias, and would have needed 616m of paved runway to come to a stop but there was only 438m available.

Mr Darlington added: ""The AAIB investigation didn't identify a technical cause for this accident.""

Detective Sergeant Paula James, of Hampshire Police, said the victims of the crash were identified by their dental records because their bodies were ""incredibly charred"".

In a statement read to the court, Saad bin Laden, brother of Sana bin Laden, said his family had flown back from Milan in Italy, having attended a family wedding at Lake Como, and his last contact with them had been a WhatsApp photograph of the three of them that morning.

Mr bin Laden said the pilot had flown to Blackbushe four or five times previously and added: ""I would regard him as a conscientious and careful pilot.""

The cause of death given by pathologist Dr Russell Delaney for all four victims was ""the effects of fire"" but added that they would most likely have lost consciousness from carbon monoxide prior to their bodies being ""incinerated"" by the fire which engulfed the aircraft.

Al-Qaida leader Bin Laden, who claimed responsibility for the September 11 2001 attacks in the United States, is believed to have had more than 50 brothers and sisters and many stepmothers from his estranged family in Saudi Arabia.","dramatic"

But Nicola has relived the horrifying ordeal which saw Isabella sucked into the filter – leaving her with horrific bowel injuries.

After splashing around in the Admiral Hotel’s hot tub at Zlanti Piasatzi, they were getting ready to leave.

But the family did not know the hot tub filter was lying open under the water, Nicola claims.

Suddenly Isabella started screaming: “My tummy, my tummy.”

“She’d been sucked in and wasn’t strong enough to push herself out,” Nicola explained.

“I tried with everything I had, pulling away, but I couldn’t free her either.”

“Mum ran to get the lifeguard and the staff turned the electricity off. It was only then that I could get hold of her. When I pulled her out, her intestine was in my hands.”

Emergency services rushed Isabella to St Anna’s Hospital where she underwent surgery and was placed on a life support machine.

Isabella eventually awoke on March 3 and is now walking again, but still on a long road to recovery.

Nicola said: “Her stomach is still open at the moment, so she’ll need surgery to close it up and then we’ll go from there.

“We’re taking things day by day, but at least it’s not hour by hour anymore.

In comparison, only 13% said “penis size” was the key to being good in the sack.

Those who finish a little too early can breathe a sigh of relief too as only 7% said stamina makes someone good in bed.

On January 21 this year, the day after Donald Trump became America’s 45th President, millions of women across the world took to the streets in a peaceful protest to march for their rights.

The event made headlines around the world and the “pussyhats” became a mainstay in pop culture – even appearing on the cover of TIME magazine and The New Yorker.

But what is International Women’s Day and why do we celebrate it?

What is International Women’s Day?

IWD was originally called International Working Women’s Day and was first celebrated on February 28, 1909 in New York City.

It was a remembrance of a 1908 strike when 15,000 workers of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union marched to demand political and social rights.

The IWD as we know it now was first held in 1914 on March 8. The day was chosen because it was a Sunday, a day many women would have free which meant they could participate in the marches.

What does IWD mean?

According to the United Nations (UN), it’s, “a day when women are recognised for their achievements without regard to divisions, whether national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political.”

“It is an occasion for looking back on past struggles and accomplishments, and more importantly, for looking ahead to the untapped potential and opportunities that await future generations of women.”

What is this year’s IWD theme?

There has been a theme assigned to each IWD day by the UN since 1996. This year’s theme is “Be bold for change.”

This is all about making the world a more “gender inclusive” place and getting women to actively take part in something that can make a big difference.

How do people celebrate IWD?

The day is an official holiday in several countries including Cambodia, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Zambia and Vietnam.

Nepal, China and Madagascar have it as an official holiday for women only.

The same people who organised this year’s women’s march have planned a “day without a woman” to coincide with the day.

“In the same spirit of love and liberation that inspired the Women's March, we join together in making March 8th A Day Without a Woman, recognising the enormous value that women of all backgrounds add to our socio-economic system--while receiving lower wages and experiencing greater inequities, vulnerability to discrimination, sexual harassment, and job insecurity,” the women’s march organisers wrote on their site.

“We recognise that trans and gender nonconforming people face heightened levels of discrimination, social oppression and political targeting. We believe in gender justice.”

How can you get involved?

If you want to participate in a day without a woman, the march group suggest you take the day off from paid and unpaid labour, avoid shopping for a day and wear red in solidarity.

Alternatively, IWD is a day for celebrating all the wonderful women in your life. So get together with your friends, talk to your mum, sisters, daughters and let them know just how appreciated they are.","boorish"

“It has been ‘claimed’ that four people did not board the plane. That would make the final number of seats used down at 224.""

He continued: “Add the 2 children and you get 226 passengers. Now add the 12 crew.

“That means that there should only be 238 missing people and not 239 as is the official record.

“So now we have an ‘extra’ person on board MH370.”

Mr Milne’s theory is that the “other” person on the flight was a hijacker who took down the jet.

He added: “The extra passenger likely acted in conjunction with larger external operational support to take full command and control of the cockpit of MH370.”

But MH370 investigators said they are aware of the bizarre anomaly.

A spokesperson said: ""We are aware of this discrepancy.

""The actual number of passengers on-board was 227.

""Page 575 is a copy of the computerised Load sheet which was transmitted about 2 hours before the aircraft departure.

""The actual figures can differ from that transmitted on the load sheet due to last minute changes (LMC).”

Another theory has emerged that North Korea’s despot leader is behind the disappearance, having “stolen” the plane.","dramatic"

Some suspect his continued drug use eventually led to the unravelling of the Third Reich as his leadership began to falter.

""Hitler needed those highs to substitute [for] his natural charisma, which he had lost in the course of the war,"" Ohler told NPR.

“What puzzles everyone who studies Hitler in those last months of his life is his shaking, his tremor.

“It can even been seen on some of the footage that has been shot and has been released, even by the Nazi propaganda machine, where we can see Hitler shaking the hands of young kids, Hitler Youth, very late in the war effort and his whole body is shaking and his hand is shaking without even shaking the hands of these kids.

“Some historians have claimed that this is the result of Parkinson's disease, because Morell, in fact, administered a medicine against Parkinson's once in April 1945.

“So perhaps Hitler did suffer from Parkinson’s, it's a bit hard to say in retrospect.”

It has also been suggested that his shaking and “tweaking” – a slang term for the frantic and compulsive behaviour associated with meth abuse – might have been due to the effects of opioid withdrawal, although modern science has since established an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease in meth addicts.

While the common stingray typically reaches lengths of around 45cm, the giant freshwater stingray – as seen in the clip – can grow to more than 6 feet across, weighing 600kg (1322lbs).

The remarkable species is found across certain parts of south-east Asia but is currently classified as an endangered species due to loss of habitat and overfishing.

Stingray are a group of rays that are distantly related to sharks.

Their diet consists of smaller fish and crustaceans they stumble upon while hovering around the riverbed.

The animal has been thrust into the forefront of popular culture in recent years after the death of beloved wildlife enthusiast Steve Irwin.

Famed for his interactions with some of the world’s most dangerous creatures, The Crocodile Hunter was fatally injured during a freak accident at the Great Barrier Reed when an eight-foot stingray spiked him through the heart during a frenzied attack.

It is believed the panicked animal had mistaken Irwin for a larger predator.

Attacks such as the one that killed Irwin are incredibly rare, as the animal is known to be skittish and shy.

Historically, stingray skin has been used by many cultures to build tools thanks to its hard, rough texture.

In ancient Japan, it was used as a non-slip grip on the handle of swords.","dramatic"

A furious senior judge slammed Cumbria Police for releasing Verebes, who had previously been jailed for attacking Ms Korosi, 33.

Verebes was convicted of three counts of rape and murder, before being sentenced to a minimum term of 28 years.

While he was behind bars Ms Korosi told police Verebes had forced her to have sex against her will.

Once released on licence he was arrested and quizzed by cops, but released on bail without charge.

Two days later Ms Korosi's neighbours were woken by a loud banging coming from her home in Carlisle.

Prosecutor Andrew Thomas QC told the court: ""They saw Verebes clambering into her house through the smashed kitchen window – and then heard the victim scream.

""The neighbours immediately realised that Miss Korosi was in danger.""

The jury heard the 999 call made that day by neighbour Rebecca Wilkinson who told the call handler: ""He's gone upstairs. He's going to kill her....Hurry up, please. She's just screamed like a baby.""

Police were quickly on the scene but after forcing their way in they found her sprawled on the floor with blood gushing from a gaping neck wound.

Verebes was still at the house and covered in the victim's blood, casually telling police: ""It's too late. She's dead.""

After being arrested for murder, he told an officer: ""I know what I did. I wanted to kill her.""

The jury heard the Hungarian couple had met in their homeland before travelling to the UK to start a new life and lived together in a house in Carlisle.

But the pair split after he was jailed for a short period last July for attacking her.

Verebes admitted to the killing in court but claimed he was guilty of manslaughter through a “loss of control” rather than murder.

He later backtracked again, claiming he had arrived at Miss Korosi's home that morning to be confronted by a knife-wielding stranger.

He said the killer had spoken his native Hungarian and threatened to kill him if he told police about what he witnessed.

But sentencing Verebes to life, the judge remarked: ""It was a murder of quite unusual savagery and brutality, causing the most dreadful of injuries.""

Criticising the police, Mr Justice Openshaw said: ""For reasons which I don't begin to understand, Verebes was released without charge.

""That decision is now under review by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.""

Bradford Crown Court, West Yorks., heard the victim had screamed but Syed had said if she did not let him do it, he would ""kill her and bury her there"".

The father-of-five had denied charges of rape and perverting the course of justice but was convicted after a jury took less than two hours to find him guilty.

He was cleared of a charge of causing the girl's mother actual bodily harm by attacking her with a knife at the takeaway where she worked.

During the trial, prosecutor Sharon Beattie said Syed had befriended the girl's family and had given her phones, clothes and a computer tablet.

Her mother became suspicious but Syed told her he wanted to help as the family were not well off.

The woman confronted the child, telling her she knew ""the old man"", as they called Syed, had collected her from school.

The police were informed when the girl revealed that Syed had forced her to have sex with him.

Miss Beattie said: ""She was screaming but he said if she did not let him do it, he would kill her and bury her there.""

The jury heard that Syed's semen was found on the inside of the girl's school trousers after the incident and Dr Mark Dale said forensic results were ""in-keeping with the view he had engaged in some kind of sexual activity"" with her.

Syed told the police the girl's mother ""would do anything for money"" and blamed her for ""putting her up"" to inventing the rape allegation.

He said his semen had already been on the trousers before he gave them to the girl and asserted he had taken her for an abortion at a clinic in Leeds on the day the rape took place.

Ordering him to register as a sex offender for life and jailing him for 13 years, Judge David Hatton, QC told Syed: ""You took a girl barely into her thirteenth year to an isolated location. You defiled her.

""You had targeted her for that specific purpose. This offence was a consequence of grooming.

""You issued threats of what would become of her unless she kept her silence. You terrified her.

In fact it can make lots of men self-conscious but the results of a new study show that, unsurprisingly, lots of guys lie about the size of their manhood.

A survey by dating website SaucyDates.com asked men from different countries to estimate the length of their erect penis while asking women about the erect size of their last sexual partner.

Then researchers revealed the nationalities that are most prone to lying about penis size – and which ones are the most truthful.

It turns out Australian lads are most likely to overestimate how much they’re really packing Down Under.

Aussie men reported their average penis size as 7.09 inches, but the Sheilas say a normal guy’s schlong measures 5.58 inches.

But how did the Brits measure up?

Lads from the UK reckoned their penises measure 6.89 inches long but women think they’re smaller.

Ladies said guys fall shorter than that, revealing that men tend to be packing 6.64 inches downstairs.

And Canadians were found to be the most modest about their goods.

Men estimated the regular schlong to be 6.84 inches in length while ladies boasted of the biggest sized schlong of all – coming in at 6.96 inches.

Researchers said: “If you ask a man the size of their penis in general you should subtract 5.6% off the total length, mathematically speaking, of course.

“But if he claims to be 8 inches or more then you can cancel that call to trade descriptions or better business bureau.

“If you are looking for a monstrous-sized penis then you should focus your efforts on UK men as 1 in 20 will have enough inches to need a bigger ruler.

The report has suggested that instead of an iPhone 8 branded device, Apple will debut the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus later this year.

These incremental handset updates will launch and brand new, super high-end device dubbed the iPhone Edition.

Citing unnamed insiders, the report has claimed that although debuting alongside its 7S siblings this September, the top flight phone won’t hit retailers’ shelves at the same time.

“This iPhone Edition will be published with iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus at the special event in September,” the report states.

That’s because the Facebook-owned messenger service has started testing a new feature that will allow businesses and companies to talk to you through the platform.

According to communications about the project seen by Reuters, the tests are already being conduced with a small selection of companies currently part of the Y Combinator startup incubator.

With WhatsApp free to download and featuring no ads, it’s believed the move will be introduced as Facebook looks to finally monetise the service that has more than 1 billion global users.

Despite having splashed out a staggering $19 billion on WhatsApp, Facebook has yet to generate revenue on the service itself.

For those tired of receiving spam emails and junk mail through the post, however, this could be the end of their friendship with the free messaging service.

Despite WhatsApp having previously stated it would allow businesses to get in touch with consumers using the service, details on what the update will look like are currently unclear.

It’s been reported, however, that WhatsApp is going to extensive lengths to avoid the platform being hit by an influx of spam.

Whats more, the incoming costs won’t affect users, with the rates to be directed at businesses instead.

Although the trial is still in the early stages, one, slightly unusual use case has emerged.

One of the start ups involved in the early tests is Cowlar, a firm responsible for making dairy collars that provide data on how to improve milk yield on cow hearts.

The service would allow farmers to receive automatic alerts if a cow is behaving unusually or is wondering off.

Well, researchers have now figured out a way to bring the 3310’s best feature - it’s unwavering battery life - back to the masses.

Producing the first all-solid-state battery cells, a team of researchers at the University of Texas have created a battery three times denser than the the lithium-ion batteries found in current smartphones.

That means instead of necessary nightly charges, you will soon be getting that week-long staying power you’ve long coveted.

The research, led by 98 year old Professor John B. Goodenough, the inventor of the lithium-ion battery, has demonstrated how the technology will work.

While current lithium-ion batteries use liquid electrolytes to transport charged ions between the negative anode and position cathode, with the energy created generating power, the new battery does things slightly differently.

“If a battery cell is charged too quickly, it can cause dendrites or “metal whiskers” to form and cross through the liquid electrolytes, causing a short circuit that can lead to explosions and fires,” the research team explained.

“Instead of liquid electrolytes, the researchers rely on glass electrolytes that enable the use of an alkali-metal anode without the formation of dendrites.”

Although you won’t see it on this year’s iPhone 8, it’s claimed the new battery tech could power the smartphones of the future.

As well as ensuring your smartphone doesn’t conk out just as you sit down for your evening commute, the futuristic battery tech could also be used to power upcoming fleets of driverless cars.

“Cost, safety, energy density, rates of charge and discharge and cycle life are critical for battery-driven cars to be more widely adopted,” said Professor Goodenough.

“We believe our discovery solves many of the problems that are inherent in today’s batteries.”

With the batteries also capable of standing up to subzero temperatures, Professor Goodenough and his team are currently looking for smartphone manufacturers to partner with.

Smartphone battery stability was called into question last year with the exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco.

With the high-end device having been hit with a global recall, Samsung has forced to apologies and change its production process.

“We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” said Koh Dong-jin, head of Samsung Mobile.

“We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing.

“We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again.”

“We look forward to moving ahead with a renewed commitment to safety. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture,” the company said.","geeky"

In a landmark decision, the Premier League has secured the ability to block users from watching league matches without paying for the privilege.

Although Kodi boxes let you legitimately access all of your paid-for online content in one place, illegal “fully loaded” boxes have been popping.

These feature add-ons that offer subscription-free access to all manner of blockbuster movies, TV shows and premium sports channels.

This is what the Premier League has secured permission to crack down on.

A new court order lets the Premier League block entire computer servers used to power the illegal streams.

Previously, they were only able to block individual video streams, although these were easy for subscription shunners to re-establish the the feeds on different links.

It’s been suggested that the move will allow the football league to target pirates in a “precise manner’.

“For the first time this will enable the Premier League to disrupt and prevent the illegal streaming of our matches via IPTV, so-called Kodi, boxes,” a Premier League spokesman said.

With their dodgy streams being blocked, footy fans are instead being urger to take up Sky Sports or BT Sport subscriptions, although this will cost significant amounts per month.

Kodi boxes allow users to access a host of online content, including services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

Recent estimates have suggested there are as many as 20 million Kodi devices currently in use in the UK.

“Streaming boxes have steadily increased in popularity in recent years,” Torrentfreak’s Ernesto van der Sar told the BBC.

“Most use the entirely legal Kodi software, but some are augmented with illegal third-party add-ons.

“Nowadays people often prefer to stream pirated content instead of using traditional torrent sites.”

Earlier this week Kodi boxes came under attack from the Intellectual Property Office, with the IPO launching a bid to try halt sales of the devices.

In a post about its consultation about Kodi boxes, the IPO said: “Despite the legitimate use of this equipment, software is widely available (illicit Kodi extensions being the best known) which connect the boxes to illegal content through streaming websites, file lockers and BitTorrent trackers.

“Broadcasters and content owners have voiced concerns that, although a range of existing legislation applies to the sale and use of these devices (as well as the provision of illicit content streams), the legal framework does not provide sufficient tools to tackle this growing threat.”

The IPO consultation will close on April 7th of this year.","geeky"

Anyone seeing the post in their timeline are being told NOT call the number and instead immediately close their internet browser and run anti-virus software.

The scam warning was made by Lancashire Police on their Facebook page after receiving calls from concerned residents over the weekend.

In the Facebook post, a spokesman for the force said: ""We have received a few enquires regarding an internet scam that is doing the rounds again on Facebook.

""The scam involves a user clicking on a link in Facebook that states a celebrity has died these include Graham Norton and Noel Edmonds (they haven't), when you click on the link two pop ups will appear claiming that your computer has been infected and that you need to call this number 08000698622 the 2nd will be an American voice stating the same.

""Please do not ring this number, close the windows and run your Anti-virus software to do the check.

""Stay safe and never divulge personal information without checking and knowing that you're speaking to the genuine company.""

People who do end up clicking on the link have been advised to get in touch with Action Fraud - the national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre.

The warning was posted on the Lancashire Police Facebook page and has been shared almost 7,000 times.

Facebook users have now taken to the social media site after seeing the ‘celebrity death’ scam appear in their news feed.

One user wrote: “If you see a newslink on Facebook saying Graham Norton has died, don't click on it.

“It brings up a vocal warning and a microsoft link saying that your computer has been infected and asks you to enter your Facebook login details.

""The skin flaps are like elastic bands, if I was to pull them I could get them down to my thigh,"" she said in BBC Three documentary, My Unusual Vagina.

""For me sex is difficult, because it can hurt and feel uncomfortable.""

The brunette told how men in the past had given her a complex, with comments such as “I can’t wait to sleep with someone with a normal vagina” and “you’ve got a pair of balls”.

Despite her enlarged labia causing her swelling and discomfort, the NHS wouldn’t provide surgery so Antonia had to fork out £3,100 on a private clinic.

“Life will be so much different for me during this surgery because I’m going to put to bed my insecurities,” she said before the operation.

“I’m going to feel so much happier and confident in my life and I know that will reflect in every aspect of my life.”

But it didn’t go quite to plan.

Antonia revealed her left side healed perfectly, whereas the right side was left swollen and deformed.

The new study found 70 per cent of current mums with dependent children say their generation is the loneliest ever, compared to 14 per cent who believe it was their own mothers and 16 per cent who feel it was their grandmothers who were most alone.

Of mums who do feel disconnected and abandoned, a huge 61 per cent try to hide their feelings from friends and family, and only 38 per cent have ever told their partner how they feel.

Youtube

Even going to baby groups where other new mums bring their kids to make friends, the vast majority are still likely to be feeling secretly lonely on a day-to-day basis.

Now The Mum Village is bringing these common hidden problems to the surface in a refreshingly honest video.

Mums interviewed admit to secretly crying or feeling jealous when they see groups of mums socialising easily in public.

One said: ""I am of course honoured to be a mum, but it doesn't stop sometimes craving conversation.""

""Being a mum can be amazing. It can also be a big pile of sh**"" is the main message which brave parents should no longer feel ashamed to admit, according to the Mum Channel.

Worryingly, 55 per cent of lonely mums say being isolated has left them suffering anxiety, while 47 per cent feel ‘very stressed’.

Loneliness has also led mums to crying regularly, many have struggled to leave the house and one in 20 admit drinking to cope.

Sixteen per cent of mums have got angry with their children due to their unhappiness.

The ChannelMum.com poll of 2,025 mothers found the biggest source of isolation comes from ‘cliquey and bitchy’ groups at the school gates or baby and toddler groups, with 51 per cent of mothers revealing they feel excluded.

A quarter feel alone as they live far from their own families while a third feel other mums are coping better or they don’t know how to meet more ""mummy mates"".

Even in an age of constant social media, scrolling on a smartphone can actually make the problems worse. Two in five mums admit seeing other mums' ""perfect lives"" gets them down, while a third compare their bodies to these women online.

And it is rich mums who are most likely to be isolated with 70 per cent of mothers polled saying they wouldn’t approach a wealthy or upper class mum to be a friend.

Over half of Muslim mums admit they feel lonely as other mothers are hesitant about approaching them - with just over a third (35 per cent) of non-Muslim mothers admitting they are nervous about speaking with a mum who wore a Hijab.

One in five also said they are worried about making friends with a mum who has children with special needs, along with seven per cent who are frightened about befriending single mums.

Meanwhile older mums are slightly more likely to feel isolated (17 per cent) compared to younger mums (11 per cent).

The study showed the main reasons mums are scared to approach other mothers is being judged, with four in 10 fearing they ""will be looked down on"".

Overall, the report also revealed 80 per cent of mothers want more mum friends - but 30 per cent have never started a conversation with another mother which led to them being friends.

Solutions suggested by the mums were slowing down their busy lives to talk, and being less judgemental.

To support lonely mums, ChannelMum.com has launched the #CMYANA (You Are Not Alone) Challenge, to help connect mums online and offline. Mums are being challenged to carry out one of five daily activities to widen their friendship group, meet new mums and feel supported.

Siobhan Freegard, founder of ChannelMum.com, admits she suffered crippling loneliness after the birth of her first child.

She said: “We all know having a child takes a physical toll on your body, but it can take a mental toll too.

“Being a mum can be tough but we need to remember there is more that unites us than divides us.

She captioned the video “Outdoor showers are the best,” and it’s hard to disagree.

New pictures show the plastic surgery addict being put through a “strenuous” exercise regime in Spain's Marbella with former Life on Marbs star, Danni Levy.

The picture comes just a week after Rodrigo claimed he was “desperate to lose two stone” after he gained weight as a result of staying indoors after his latest surgery.

The 33-year-old has now undergone 51 cosmetic procedures which have cost him £373,000.

The latest is c02 resurfacing – a procedure which removed a layer of skin with a carbon dioxide laser.

“I had a very productive day in Marbella today,” the half-Brazilian, half-British personality wrote on his 241,000-strong Instagram page.

“I’m [on] a very strict diet designed by my wonderful friend @dannilevytv and a very good work at beach with sun-protection factor 100% to protect my beauty after #co2.”

Rodrigo managed to show off his £10,000 pec implants and £22,000 fake six pack while he worked out on the beach.

Rodrigo’s surgeries began when he was just 19-years-old – when he decided to have a nose job so he would stop being bullied by his peers.

“Male perfection is to me having symmetry. So a chiselled face, broad shoulders, a lean figure, a prominent jaw line, defined abs and a chest in proportion,” Rodrigo said.

“I have had a hair implant, a brow lift, eye lifts, my ears pinned back, cheeks redesigned, my jawline shaped, I’ve had cheek implants twice, the sides if my lips cut out in order to give me a bigger wider smile. I have had fillers injected into my shoulders, biceps, triceps, my abs – my six pack is purely plastic surgery.

“I have the most beautiful six pack.”

While it is unknown how Rodrigo finances his obsession, a “massive inheritance” from his grandfather has helped considerably as has his rental property in Puerto Banus, Spain.","boorish"

She easily tucked into the giant feast at Pizza Barn in Yonkers, New York.

After thousands of people saw and shared her video online, many were putting the restaurant on their list of dream places to visit.

But after a decade in the industry, the New Yorker has ditched the porn to become a pastor after finding God and marrying a fellow member of the cloth.

The 33-year-old fell pregnant at 16 and having done modelling and pole dancing, moved into the adult industry to pay the bills on a house in a safe neighbourhood in Hollywood where she raised her son.

She was told she could earn $30,000 (£25,000) a month in porn and turned to alcohol to get through the shoots.

She said: “It just became like this daily routine for me where I would drop my son off to school in the morning, go do a shoot and come home. It was like a regular 9 to 5 job.”

While buying things most people would love – sports cars, a nightclub and a mansion – Crystal says she was sucked in by a materialistic lifestyle and “lost herself”.

She said: “My mind was so messed up and after reading the Bible I know that I was haunted by a spirit of Jezebel.

“I just lived for myself and my son and didn’t really think about the consequences of making films and dancing and everything.

""I started to become an object. I wouldn’t walk outside my house without showing cleavage, having a belly shirt on and high heels. It was like had to constantly look like the sex symbol.”

Shortly before meeting her future husband David - a pastor - Crystal decided to shun the porn world and devote her life to God instead.

She said: “He’d known about my past for years because my sister was going to his church. David is the kind of guy that thinks your past is your past. You can't keep looking back at it. It's done with.

""It is definitely the ultimate change. It's going from one extreme to the next. I had to get away from this whole life.""

The couple married in December 2014, and they were soon joined by their son Carter, who was welcomed by older brothers 16-year-old Justin and seven-year-old Landon.

David, 26, said: “What I would like people to take away from us is that God can forgive you no matter what past you come from.”

Crystal turned her life around after leaving the porn industry and soon graduated from college to become a paralegal and trained as a pastor.

After marrying, David and Crystal founded their own church called New Beginnings Christian Life in Fulton, New York where they hope to inspire others.

Crystal said: “I look back at my past now and you know I can’t say that I really regret anything because it has made me who I am today.

“It’s like if I grew up as a teacher, I probably wouldn’t be helping people now. I probably would be completely different.

But despite a huge investigation, the suspect was never found and Biggie’s killer remains at large.

However, a clue to who killed the 24-year-old may be in a video of the shooting.

Young mum Lauren was ""crying in fear and shock"" when she found out her daughters had twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) when she was still pregnant.

TTTS is a rare condition where one twin receives more blood than the other while in the womb - sadly it can be fatal or cause disability.

New parents Graham Lucas, 27, and Lauren Smith, 23, were ""broken-hearted"" when an operation failed and newborn Elouise passed away in Lauren's arms.

Now Lauren's cousin Jodie will take on white hot geysers and death-defying fjords to raise cash for a charity that supports twins.

Luckily, twin sister Ava did survive - and Jodie's death-defying trek will be in honour of the treasured tot.

Now two years old, Ava is a smiley, healthy child who enjoys a close relationship with her loving cousin.

But her parents won't ever forget her twin - and miss her every day.

Jodie, from Thorney in Peterborough, said: “Lauren often tells me it feels like a different life – like she was watching it happen to someone else in a film. It’s horrible to see that happen to someone in your family.”

Risking harsh weather conditions, Jodie will camp in the wild for three nights.

Jodie Hutson

During the day, she will trek with a group across 58km (36 miles) of fearsome Icelandic terrain.

Jodie admits the trek will be ""a real challenge for me"", which will be tough on her emotions as well as her body.

Speaking to Daily Star Online exclusively, she said: “I don’t think some of my friends truly understand just how difficult this trek is going to be – it’ll be incredibly hard.

""But Lauren has to live through the pain of losing Elouise every single day. I don’t want anyone to have to ever go through what she went through.”

Blisters, swollen joints and aching muscles are the norm for Jodie, who goes out hiking on weekends with 20k of weight on her back.

The 27-year-old says the tough training has sometimes been too much to bear - but thinking of her tiny second cousins keeps her going.

Jodie Hutson

She said: “I’ve had moments in my training where I’ve really struggled.”

“But Elouise and Ava are always there in my mind.

“A few weekends ago I went for a walk and I was covered in blisters and really fed up.

""Then I had this feeling come over me, I can’t really explain it, and it urged me to carry on. It went from being a really miserable walk to one of my favourites.""

With Mount Snowdon under her belt - and sights set on the UK's tallest peak Ben Nevis in April - the hardened adventurer is confident she can reach her goal and raise £3,000.

Funds raised will go to a research project for TTTS set up by Tamba, the only UK-wide charity dedicated to helping families with twins, triplets or other multiple births.

Charity Challenge

Keith Reed, CEO of Tamba, said: “Losing one baby while the other lives on is an incredibly difficult moment unique to our multiples families – how do you grieve for one baby and celebrate the birth of their twin?

“We want to see a world where all TTTS babies not only survive, but go on to thrive and live happy, healthy lives free of disabilities.

Horrified witnesses described the frenzied stabbing at a block of flats at Wolverhampton as a ""war zone"".

Armed police stormed the flat with dogs, helicopters and stun grenades and found the man and his sister dead.

A 59-year-old woman was found critically injured with life-threatening stab wounds.

The man, thought to be 36, killed himself after stabbing his two family members, West Midlands Police said.

Riot police stormed the flat but were could save the pair at Highfield Court, a block of flats in Leasowes Drive, in the Merry Hill area of the city.

One officer suffered a minor knife injury to his arm, while another suffered a leg injury sustained during the operation.

The woman was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham where she remains in a critical condition.

Residents gathered outside the 15-storey tower block reported hearing gunshots coming from a flat.

But police said there were no firearms involved in the bloodbath.

Pauline Turner, who lives on the eighth floor, said: ""The first I knew of it was when all the sirens started blaring and the helicopters landed. It was like a war zone.

""I heard the police trying to bash down the door to a flat just before 10. It was so loud, the sound shook right through my flat. I think they might have used grenades too.""

Janet Room, 68, lives opposite Highfield Court and said the estate was 'crawling' with emergency services this morning.

She said: ""The first thing I heard was a a helicopter, and when I looked outside the place was crawling.

""Someone said there was a shooting or a stabbing.""

One neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: ""At first we thought we had heard gunshots coming from a flat below us.

""But when we got outside and saw all the police and the smoke we realised it had been some sort of stun grenades.

""I've never seen anything like it in my life, there were armed cops everywhere and three air ambulances. It was really dramatic, like some sort of disaster film.

""We were told it was a domestic stabbing and two people had died. It is really tragic.""

Sean Delaney, who lives on the ground floor, said police told him to ""get out now"" as he was getting ready to leave.

Wolverhampton Police Superintendent Keith Fraser said: “We understand the attacker and victims were known to each other but the precise nature of their relationship is unclear at this stage.

“Our officers knew there was an armed man behind the front door of that flat, they acted swiftly and with huge courage to quickly gain entry and detain the man. However, it was clear he too had suffered a serious knife wound and died shortly afterwards.

“Local officers, response colleagues and firearms officers were all involved in the operation.

“This is a truly shocking incident and our sympathies go out to the friends and family of those involved.”

Forensics officers were at the scene this afternoon and police were not looking for anyone else over the double killing.","dramatic"

His mother Nicola said she had begged officers to keep the landfill site locked down after he vanished six months ago.

Though they initially sealed it off officers announced last October they were allowing it to re-open because they were certain he was not there.

It had not been searched but due to the light weight of bins emptied from the loading bay he vanished from detectives who were convinced he could not have been transported to the tip.

Police have since discovered the weight data had been incorrectly logged – making it possible Corrie had been taken to the dump.

Officers continue to sift through 60 tons of rubbish up to eight metres deep over an area of 920 square metres at the tip in Milton, near Cambridge.

They predict the search could take up to 10 weeks.

But Nicola said it was only down to ""sheer luck"" they did not face a much bigger task.

Though the landfill owners had been given legal permission to start piling rubbish back on top of the section where Corrie’s body may have been dumped they had not done so.

''It was not by design that no more waste was piled on top,'' Nicola said.

''It is just luck.

''I think that the area may have already been full, but I was not told why.''

She said police had led her to believe the section where her son may be buried was being used to dump waste again despite her “begging"" officers to keep it sealed off.

Stephen Lock/i-Images

A Suffolk Police spokesman said though the force allowed the landfill to reopen officers had kept in touch with site owner FCC Environment and ""nothing further was deposited on the area where the waste collected that evening was placed"".

''When an initial decision not to search the landfill was made we remained in contact with the site who had identified where the waste had been deposited. They placed nothing further on top of this.

''Had anything further been deposited we would have encompassed this in the current search,'' the spokesman added.

Yesterday followers of Nicola's campaign to find her son announced they had nominated her for an award for the inspirational strength, integrity and patience she has displayed.

But she admitted she had suffered 'additional grief' after reading 'awful comments' in some online discussions about her son's 'sexuality' and claims he had gone 'awol'.

''Those that stand by are as guilty as those making awful comments,'' she wrote on the official Facebook site to find her son.

''Your presence encourages the very worst of humanity to hammer away on their keyboards to you, their audience.

''This sadly only causes me additional grief.''

Corrie, who was stationed at RAF Honington, vanished after a night out with pals in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, last September (2016).

Police suspect he may have crawled into a wheelie bin to keep warm in the early hours and been either crushed or suffocated when it was emptied.","dramatic"

According to a new survey, a whopping 75% of Brits admitted lying to their partners and one in 10 reckon they do it regularly – with men expected to tell the most porkies.

The poll of 2,000 adults by TV show Imposters also found that a quarter of the population don’t completely trust their current partner and 5% don’t trust them at all.

Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James said: “We Brits can sometimes be a rather suspicious bunch, but it seems we may have every right to be cautious since this research finds most people admit to lying to their partners, or being lied to.

“I’m surprised to see so many couples don’t trust each other though.”

Brits said they’re comfortable fibbing and on average tell 10 lies per day – a mixture of white lies and more serious deceptions.

Half of the population has been lied to in a relationship, with almost 30% saying the lie was serious.

Some naughty fibbers even admitted to telling lies to con someone into starting a relationship with them – and more than a third have maintained that deception to this day.

Just two thirds of the population say they trust their partner to remain faithful.

Honey continued: “In all of our relationships – whether romantic, friendly or in the workplace – trust is a very important issue and necessary for a healthy relationship dynamic.

“I was surprised by how many respondents said they were happy to bend the truth.

""It seems you have to be careful who you trust and ensure you know someone very well indeed.

“Until you are in a genuinely committed relationship with someone you know well, and know has your best interests at heart, the only person you can really rely on is yourself.”

Although men do reach climax a lot more regularly than ladies, it’s still important that they are experiencing the height of pleasure.

A recent study even claimed that men should orgasm every day, to lower their risk of prostate cancer. So if you ever needed an excuse to have more sex, there’s one right there.

Men’s orgasms might not last as long as women’s or be as intense, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be earth-shattering, mind-blowing, toe-curling experiences.

We’re sure you’ve already got a few tricks up your sleeve, but here are four easy ways to give him an even more intense orgasm:

1. Give him an eyeful

Men’s arousal is strongly linked to visual experience, according to multiple scientific studies.

As soon as a lust-inspiring image registers in their brain, they become turned-on—not only physically but psychologically too.

So if you’re comfortable with it try giving him a little strip tease before the act or just leave the lights on for a change.

This will increase the build-up and lead to a stronger orgasm.

2. Foreplay

We constantly emphasis the importance of foreplay for women, but it’s just as pleasurable for men.

A slow mental build-up will intensify his arousal. Try starting with sensual kisses and then drag your lips from his neck up to his ear.

You can then tease him by gently stroking him all over to activate erogenous nerve endings.

3. Bring him to the edge

Keep building him up until he’s on the edge of orgasm, but don’t let him finish.

Continue doing this until he begs you to let him finish. It will create so much sexual tension and make the final climax even more pleasurable.

4. Touch his perineum

This is the stretch of skin between his balls and his butt and it’s super sensitive.

“The area is packed with nerve-endings so it feels really sensitive,” said Arlene Goldman, PHD. co-auther of Secrets of Sexual Ecstasy.

Some guys even claim to have multiple orgasms when pressure is applied to this area.","vulgar"

A new study has revealed the more sex you have, the higher your levels of job engagement and job satisfaction.

The study by Oregon State University’s College of Business surveyed 159 married workers or two weeks and monitored their sexual activity and their job satisfaction.

The study was published in the Journal of Management and the researchers gave the participants three online surveys throughout the day: during the morning, afternoon and evening.

The questions asked participants how often they had sex between work shifts, their mood and how involved they were in their work that day.

The research found those who prioritised their sex lives at home had an advantage in their careers because they were more likely to immerse themselves in their work and enjoy their jobs.

""We make jokes about people having a 'spring in their step,' but it turns out this is actually a real thing and we should pay attention to it,"" study author Keith Leavitt said.

""Maintaining a healthy relationship that includes a healthy sex life will help employees stay happy and engaged in their work, which benefits the employees and the organisations they work for.""

The study also found work-related stress had a negative impact on the participants’ sex lives and showed how important work-life balance is.

""This is a reminder that sex has social, emotional and physiological benefits, and it's important to make it a priority,"" Keith added. ""Just make time for it.""

A separate study published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour revealed people are having less sex now than they were two decades ago.

The researchers analysed data from 26,000 people between 1989 to 2014 and concluded nearly all of the participants are having sex less often – both married and single people.

For example, in 2002 an average adult had sex 64 times a year, but by 2014 they only had sex 53 times a year.

The study also found those born in the 1930s have sex 63 times per year and those born in the 1990s only about 57 times per year.

According to a new survey, a whopping 59% of women regularly pine for sex with their ex.

Perhaps this is because more than half of lusty ladies (56%) reckon they enjoyed the best sex of their lives with a previous lover.

If that wasn’t bad enough, ladies are constantly comparing current boyfriends to past loves – especially when it comes to their performance in the sack.

And if it came to acting on their filthy desires, a third would be keen to rekindle the old flame if they came across a blast from the past on a social media site.

Men however, aren’t so bothered about looking back on old times.

Less than half of guys (48%) reminisce fondly about sexual liaisons with an ex and only a quarter (24%) would want to revisit a former romance.

Although lads and ladies did agree on one thing – that love was the most important factor when it comes to having the best sex.

It’s likely that the lack of love is why few remembered having the best sex with a one night stand.

The poll conducted by extra-marital dating site IllicitEncounters.com quizzed 1,000 men and women about their dirty dreams.

Christian Grant, IllicitEncounters.com spokesman, said: “We have found the ‘greener grass syndrome' is a significant driver of female registrations.""

He continued: ""Women are becoming increasingly sexually assertive and less prepared to settle for second best in a relationship.

""Women don’t tend to marry the guy they had great sex with. They marry for more ‘sensible’ attributes – like whether he’ll be loyal and a good father.

""Mr Sensible is fine for the first five years of marriage but after that women get restless and seek excitement elsewhere – either by looking up an ex on Facebook or joining a dating site like IllicitEncounters.com.""

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/594734/How-to-give-her-a-multiple-orgasm-easy-make-her-climax","How to give her a multiple orgasm in four simple steps","A study published in Human Sexuality: An Encyclopaedia in the mid-‘90s, found when a woman orgasms she needs, on average, just one or two more minutes to reach her second climax.

The study by sex researchers William Hartman and Marilyn Fithian also recorded the most female orgasms they observed was 134 in just 60 minutes.

Author of The Elusive Orgasm, Vivienne Cass has said that multiple orgasms are possible for all women and and many are able to experience five to seven in a row.

So how can you get here there? Follow these four simple steps:

1. Build up the sexual tension

Building up sexual tension is the cornerstone for how to get any woman to orgasm let alone multiple times.

Begin early, text her a dirty message in the morning or give her neck a nuzzle when you get home and perhaps indulge in a little PDA.

This will make her aroused earlier and for longer which means she will be ready to go once you hit the sheets.

2. Don’t stop when she climaxes the first time

After a woman orgasms, it’s common for her clitoris to be sensitive, but that doesn’t mean you should back off completely.

Instead, attend to her breasts, butt or any other of her erogenous zones and whisper sweet nothings in her ear.

This will keep her in an aroused state so you can bring her to her second climax more easily.

3. Pick up the pace

Not unlike how an erection is caused, when a woman has an orgasm the blood rushes to her genitals which is why it’s easier to make her climax a second time.

At this point you can touch the clitoris again, lightly at first with your finger or tongue and then work up the stimulation with an increasingly faster pace and more pressure, until she reaches her peak again.

4. Try a different zone

While the clitoris is your best bet for giving her multiple orgasms, you can also test out different erogenous zones.

Try woman on top or doggy style to try and hit her G-spot and give her a vaginal orgasm. Or you can even try stimulating her nipples as some women can experience a nipple orgasm.","vulgar"

And there have been hundreds of as-yet-unexplained UFO sightings across the world over the years.

Conspiracy theorists have named a number of bizarre – and downright terrifying – incidents, sightings and unknowns that still have no scientific explanation.

Where ARE all the aliens?

According to the Fermi paradox – named after physicist Enrico Fermi – there are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun, many of which are billions of years older than Earth.

That mean there is a high probability some of these stars will have Earth-like planets – and will have developed intelligent life.

Which means there could be aliens out there – but they just haven’t visited Earth yet.

What science can’t explain is why – if aliens are out there – haven’t they visited Earth already?

Despite examining radio signals from other worlds for decades, scientists still haven’t detected any alien life.

Did we discover life on Mars already?

In 1976, the NASA Mars Viking lander was said to have “found life”.

The robot on Mars carried out three experiments to test for life. One came up positive but the other two experiments did not, so the positive result had to be dismissed.

But in 2012 a team of scientists re-examined the data using a new technique – and found evidence of biological life on the Red Planet.

Biologist Joseph Miller said: “The ultimate proof is to take a video of a Martian bacteria and watch the bacteria move.

“On the basis of what we've done so far, I'd say I'm 99 percent sure there's life there.”

How does the Placebo effect work?

The placebo effect is the unbelievable phenomenon of people overcoming illness by taking a “fake” sugar pill and believing it is really medicine.

Bizarrely, it appears to still work even when patients know they are taking a sugar pill – the simple act of taking one means they often “cure” themselves of their illness.

And it’s not just tablets, the placebo effect also works if you think you’ve had surgery – but actually haven’t had any at all.

Scientists still don’t have a solid answer for why believing you are taking medicine, when you aren’t actually, cures physical illness.

What would happen if a person fell into a black hole?

Black hole formation begins when a massive star dies and its core ends up collapsing in on itself.

A black hole is genuinely ""black"" and so it can only be detected by the effects its gravitational force has on other nearby objects.

Scientists do not know what happens if something – or someone – is sucked into a black hole.

Some theorists have suggested that anything falling into a black hole will be thrown into another universe or dimension.

Physicists used to think you wouldn’t notice you were falling into a black hole – others suggested you’d hit a wall of fire and be burnt to a crisp.

It seems there is no concrete answer – so probably best to avoid going near any.

Is telekinesis real?

Isn’t it just a trick that Uri Gellar fella used to do on TV?

Telekinesis – or mind over matter – is the ability to physically control objects without physically touching them.

70s TV magician Uri Gellar was a big name thanks to his trademark spoon bending tricks.

But others still practice the technique – and claim that they really can move objects just by using psychic abilities.

According to author and science expert Dr Claude Swanson, the odds that telekineses is real – and not due to chance – is now measured in billions to one.

“In other words, this phenomenon is real,” he said.","dubious"

Detailed analysis of their body shapes reveals their “true” sex, an armchair expert believes.

And the world-famous power couple are both members of the fabled secret society, the Illuminati.

A US Christian blogger who calls himself “MrE3000” puts forward his outrageous claims in a YouTube video that has been watched more than 31,000 times.

In it, MrE3000 says the waist is in a different position on men and women.

He claims the body goes in above the belly button on women and below the belly button on men.

He then shows lots of photos of superstar pair, which appear to show the “indent” in Brady’s torso above his belly button – suggesting he is a woman – and Gisele’s below – suggesting she is a man.

MrE3000 – who surprisingly has almost 11,000 YouTube subscribers and has amassed more than 2million views – said: “Tom Brady has an indentation above the belly button.

“Is Tom Brady a woman - a female-to-male Illuminati ‘tranny’?

“He has got this indentation right there – that’s the narrowest part of his torso – which is what you find on a woman, due to the hips.

“That’s just a medical fact – a scientific fact – that females have wider hips than men.

“It’s because of the pelvic bone underneath.

“It’s why archaeologists can find these skeletons and tell if it’s a man or a woman from the bones.”

On Gisele, he says: “She has a little indentation here [below the belly button] – that’s a masculine feature – then it goes straight up from there.

“Some photos are Photoshopped and in others she’s bending her back to give the illusion of an hour glass figure – but it’s an illusion.”

Daily Star Online contacted a number of experts on the human anatomy to test MrE3000’s wild theory.

And – amazingly – there was some truth to it.

But body boffins agreed that the bodies of men and women vary too widely to determine a person’s “original” sex by the position of their waist.

Noël Cameron, professor of human biology at Loughborough University, told the Daily Star Online: “It has sometimes been reported that the waist is above the umbilicus [belly button] in women and below it in men.

“But the human body is extremely variable and the level of the waist relative to the umbilicus in any one person is going to also be variable and dependent on age and sex – because almost every morphological measure is dependent on age and sex.

“The level of the waist will also vary depending on degree of abdominal fatness and its distribution on the trunk [torso].

“Because of this variation a specific characteristic, such as gender, cannot be determined with any degree of accuracy using a morphological measures such as the level of the waist relative to the umbilicus.”

Gary Ciment, an expert in human anatomy with Ciment Consultants, in Oregon, in the US, agreed.

He said: “In my informal observations, there are high-waisted and low-waisted individuals, but they belong to both sexes.

“It doesn't sound like a reliable indicator at all.”

MrE3000 then goes further by accusing Brady and Gisele of being members of the Illuminati – a shadowy organisation made famous by the book and movie The Da Vinci Code.

The group – supposedly made up of rich and famous people from across the world – is accused of everything from controlling global affairs to hiding the existence of aliens.

The conspiracy theorist claims Brady and Gisele have confirmed their membership with a number of hand gestures associated with the group.

These include the “V-sign” or “peace sign” – which apparently symbolises the horned, androgynous devil-god Baphomet.

Other gestures include the “OK-sign” – which allegedly represents the three sixes of the “number of the beast” – the “devil horns” normally displayed by rockers, and subtly pointing to the eye, which apparently signifies the “all-seeing eye”, as seen above the pyramid on the US dollar bill.

MrE3000 goes on to question whether Brady is a “genetically engineered super athlete”.

Based on the fact that New England Patriots quarterback Brady is one of only two players to win five Super Bowls, and has four Super Bowl Most Valuable Player awards, this is somewhat easier to believe.

Nick Pope, one of the world's leading experts on conspiracy theories, told the Daily Star Online: ""Rich and powerful people certainly get together from time to time, over port and cigars, to do deals behind closed doors. But to suggest that shadowy groups like the Illuminati secretly run the world is nonsense.

""There was a secret society called the Illuminati, founded in Bavaria in the Eighteenth century, but their aims were to restrict religious influence and to promote the wider spread of knowledge in society. They never ruled anything – openly or secretly – and they no longer exist.”

A charity for people who are transgender has pointed out there is nothing wrong with being a transvestite or transgender.

Dr Jane Hamlin, president of the Beaumont Society, the largest and longest established transgender support group in the UK, said: ""Being transgender is not a lifestyle choice.

""I do not know anyone who would choose to be transgender. It is the way we are born and consequently is perfectly natural.

""There is nothing wrong with being transgender and it is certainly nothing to be ashamed of.""

Following a number of Kodi-related arrests last month, a man has now forced to pay a massive £250,000 after being caught selling “fully loaded” Kodi boxes.

The man in question, Malcolm Mayes from Hartlepool, was found guilty of selling IPTV boxes - commonly known as Kodi boxes - that had been modified to allow users to freely access content that should be paid for.

After falsely claiming in national magazine adverts that the boxes were ‘100% legal’, Mr Mayes tried to sell the devices to a series of pubs and clubs.

With the boxes allowing those you bought them to stream live ‘pay to view’ content, such as Premier League football matches, free of charge, Mr Mayes sold the boxes for a lofty £1,000 a pop.

Although Kodi software is completely legal and lets you access all of your free and paid-for online content in a single, convenient place, plug-ins have been created that open the software up to dodgy streams.

These are illegal and infringe on a number of copyright and piracy laws.

With National Trading Standard having conducted tests on one of the boxes sold by Mr Mayes, they found it had been adapted to all pay to view content to be illegally accessed without charge.

Having pled guilty to the offences, Mr Mayes was sentenced to ten months in prison, suspended for one year, and ordered to pay costs of £170,000.

A Proceeds of Crime Act order was also made against him, with the fine accounting for a further £80,000.

“Mr Mayes knowingly sold these illegal boxes which breached copyright law, misleading small businesses by falsely claiming that these devices were legal,” said Lord Toby Harris, Chair of National Trading Standards.

“I hope this conviction sends a clear message that criminal activity doesn’t pay.”

He added: “I would also warn any person or business selling or operating such a device that they are in breach of copyright law. National Trading Standards will continue to protect legitimate business and pursue those who breach copyright in this way.”

Ian Harrison, Trading Standards & Licensing Manager for Hartlepool Borough Council added: “The cost of this case has been significant to Mr Mayes. In pleading guilty he has accepted that it is illegal to sell a device that allows the free viewing of ‘pay to view’ television. This is common sense and should be obvious to anyone.”

“Mr Mayes should not be seen as a Robin Hood type character. In selling these devices he was not stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. He was stealing from the rich to make himself richer. Many of the pubs and clubs that bought his devices lost significant amounts of money when the devices failed to operate as promised.

“We will continue to target those traders and individuals who make their living from selling counterfeit goods or in other ways allow intellectual property to be stolen.”

The news comes as the Premier League gained the legal right to block entire computer servers found to be hosting illegal streams of live football matches.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/595502/brits-30th-birthday-luckiest-age-lucky-items-rituals","Do you feel lucky? Brits approaching 30th birthday hailed as the ‘luckiest age’","The first year of your thirties has been named as the luckiest age on average, with examples of good luck dwindling as you get older.

The survey of 2,000 adults revealed that six in 10 of us consider ourselves to be lucky people, while 82 per cent believe we make our own luck.

We reckon jewellery are our luckiest items, followed by pants, socks and even favourite old toys.

One respondent’s luckiest story told of a friend arranging for an instructor to teach them to drive, who turned into their fiancé after just six weeks of lessons – they’ve now been married for 48 years.

One remembered going to meet an old friend at hospital who they hadn’t seen for a while, and from that moment they fell in love and are growing old together.

And others told of finding five pound notes stuck in a drain covers and bus stops, which led them to have a lucky day.

Winning holidays, money, phones and cars were also found to be lucky experiences Brits have had over their lifetime.

The survey was commissioned by online gaming company Casumo.com, whose spokesman Greg Tatton-Brown said: “Everyone will have their own feelings towards luck and being lucky, especially when it comes to important events.

“Each person can experience different levels of luck, whether it be a big lottery win or finding money on the floor.

“Sometimes you have to put yourself in the right place at the right time to gain some luck and we encourage people to have fun with it.”

In the survey, it was revealed that one in seven people have a type of lucky ritual they perform before meetings, matches or similar.

One respondent said that having a drink of Cola makes them feel lucky, while another said that before a football match they have a coffee in a particular mug – or run the risk of causing a loss for their team.

Other lucky rituals include wearing the same outfit for every match attended, and many Brits still own a rabbit’s foot.

The study found the most common lucky numbers to be seven and three, while others said that they always go for the number 13 – which is generally known to be unlucky.

Greg Tatton-Brown said: “It’s interesting that some people consider the number 13 to be the luckiest, perhaps this dispels the myth that it’s unlucky for some?

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/595383/pop-gang-steps-return-reunion-spice-girls-uk-tour-20th-anniversary","'We're outpacing the Spice Girls' Pop gang Steps return after 20 years for big UK tour","Claire Richards, Faye Tozer, Lisa Scott-Lee, Lee LatchfordEvans, and Ian “H” Watkins are back to celebrate their 20th anniversary.

So roll your left shoulder three times because their epic new single Scared Of The Dark lands today.

But why have Steps succeeded where their Spice rivals flopped?

“We have always said if it wasn’t the five of us we wouldn’t do it,” chimes Claire. “It would damage the legacy of what we are about otherwise and we are incredibly protective of that.”

H can’t contain himself: “I’m gutted the Spice Girls didn’t come back but I’m glad in a way because it wouldn’t be the same if it wasn’t all of them.”

Claire nods: “I totally get where Victoria Beckham and Mel C came from, not doing it, it was brave.

“But ultimately it is watering down the memory if everyone’s not involved.

“Having all five of us is more special because we are giving the fans the same... but different.”

They aren’t wrong, in the fickle world of pop music it’s rare for an original line-up to return.

Pop fan Claire agrees: “I struggle with Take That, I was such a big fan but as a three there’s something not right. Even when Robbie Williams came back recently it annoyed me, as a fan I was quite disappointed.”

Comeback single Scared Of The Dark certainly doesn’t disappoint and matches the bombastic majesty of their biggest hits.

H starts humming it: “If I wasn’t in Steps I would love this record!”

Faye joins in: “It’s so nice to have a record that we want to listen to again and again.”

Conceived as “ABBA on speed”, Steps arrived in 1997 and scored 14 consecutive top five singles.

The fivesome first reformed in 2011 for the Sky Living TV show Steps: Reunion. It aired past grievances caused by H and Claire splitting up Steps on Boxing Day 2001.

“Taking that plaster off was hard last time,” admits H. “It’s not as stressful now because it’s water under the bridge.

“We are in a happier place and have plans to keep this going.” After two decades they still look shiny and amazing, even if they have swapped pop for Pampers.

“When we look in the mirror we see tired parents,” sighs Faye, despite her faultless complexion.

“People go: ‘Don’t you look well’ but we don’t look like this at 7am!”

The father of twin boys, H is not quite as hyperactive as he once was either: “What is lovely is that most of us are parents now and we all understand and support each other.

“I’m at the early stages of parenthood, so we were talking about milk this morning and weaning them off, it’s not very rock ‘n’ roll.”

Steps have been plotting their 20th anniversary celebration, including a tour, for two years.

“It’s lucky we did because it’s taken us so long,” laughs Faye. “We had over a hundred songs submitted for this album and decided what we thought the fans would like.”

The album Tears On The Dancefloor follows next month and it was a revelation for Claire.

She explains: “It’s the first time that we have ever chosen our own songs, back in the day we were told: ‘You sing this.’

“I think our input has been the lynchpin that made it all come together so perfectly.

“Everyone has their idea of what they think Steps is, but we know how our voices blend and that made a great Steps record.”

Of course the pop landscape has changed in 2017, so will they mind not rubbing shoulders with Ed Sheeran in the Top 10?

Technophobe H concedes: “We are learning how this works with streaming – it’s not about chart positions anymore.” Claire adds: “We want Steps to be Top 5 still but we never depended on radio play anyway back in the day.

“The only time we got played on the big radio stations was when they had to because we were in the Top 10.”

What they are doing is bringing a bit of fun back to pop.

Lisa agrees: “We are not here to get into the politics but what we can offer is escapism and a bit of positivity in people’s lives.

“Music takes you to another place and time.”

Naturally there will be a cheesy new dance routine to go with the single in time for its debut on Saturday Night Takeaway.

“We are learning it this week,” Faye says excitedly.

Tickets go on sale today for the tour, which kicks off in Dublin on November 13 and hits 1 4 cities across the UK and Ireland.","boorish"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/594788/Woman-has-face-rebuilt-after-horror-car-crash-breaks-every-bone","Woman has face rebuilt after breaking every bone in horror car accident","Every bone in Kirsty Smart’s face broke when she was dragged beneath a Ford Mondeo in 2007 at 18 years old.

Left with severe brain-swelling, Kirsty’s eye sockets were crushed, her jaw hung off her face and all her teeth bar two were ripped from her mouth.

Believing her life was ruined, Kirsty re-learned to walk and talk, and used a feeding tube for three years.

Speaking from her home in Cwmbran, Wales, Kirsty said: “When I saw my reflection after the accident, I screamed. I didn’t recognise myself.

“I thought my life was over and that I was destined to live in agony, unable to work, find love or feel confident again.”

Ten years on, Kirsty, now 28 and a full-time mum to her daughter Halle, 5, has undergone 13 facial reconstruction operations.

Criminal charges were never pressed against the driver – but Kirsty was awarded a five-figure sum in compensation for her ordeal in a civil case.

Kirst added: “I fought to get my confidence back and with every op I felt stronger.

“Now, I want to be an inspiration for my daughter.”

On February 23 2007 Kirsty, then a trainee flight attendant, was dragged beneath a car when walking home from a party.

She recalls: “I was on the road when the car came up the hill and I don’t remember how it happened, but suddenly the underside of the car ripped over my face at speed.

“I was told I ‘died’ three times on the way to Royal Gwent Hospital through choking on my own blood.”

In hospital, she spent two weeks in an induced coma.

With her eye sockets, cheekbones, and skull partially crushed, Kirsty’s face was an ‘open wound’, and medics put 300 stitches in her face.

All her teeth bar two had been ripped from her palette, she’d bitten half her tongue off and her jaw bones were broken.

When she woke from the coma, Kirsty had ‘no recollection’ of the smash.

She explained: “My sister told me I’d been in an accident. I couldn’t move or speak as I had a tracheostomy tube fitted because there were holes in my nose and mouth.”

After another two weeks in hospital Kirsty discharged herself to recover at home.

She recalls: “I was reliant on my mum for everything. Dressing, bathing and changing my feeding tube.

“I avoided mirrors, knowing that the sight of myself would send me spiralling into depression.

“Feeling as though I had no future, I spent three months in my room refusing to see anyone and reading texts, mourning my old life.”

In June – four months after the accident – she consulted her surgeon about reconstruction surgery.

Kirsty recalled: “I was told I would never look the way I used to and that I would have to wait two years to begin reconstruction because of my scarring.

“I hit rock bottom, believing I would never have a job, partner or family.

“I even came close to wanting to take my own life.

But in September, after looking through photos of her ‘old life’, Kirsty realised she could not be’ selfish’ to her loved-ones by ending her life.

She explained: “Despite everything, I was still here and owed it to everyone to make my life count.”

Kirsty took an admin job but, without teeth, struggled with speech.

“I was worried my new colleagues would stare at me, but they couldn’t have been nicer,” she said.

“It was a massive confidence boost.”

In the next six months she started going out with old friends every weekend and went on a holiday to Mallorca.

She said: “People would openly stare, and there were times I left nights out because I felt embarrassed.

“But I realised they were the ones with the problem and ignored it.”

In 2009 she began reconstructive ops and bone from her skull was used to rebuild her nose.

Six months later, she had her next operation in which her hip bone was used to rebuild her palate.

But the bone rejected, meaning that she could not have permanent teeth fitted and instead had dentures fitted in 2010.

These allowed her to eat and speak properly - though nerve damage in her face left her with no sense of smell or taste.

She dated a few men over the years and had a daughter with one partner in 2011, though they are no longer together.

“Though that relationship didn’t work out, I was thrilled that I had a daughter, Halle.

“I never thought I’d be a mother, I felt so blessed and knew I had to set an example to her.”

In 2015 she had her thirteenth and most recent op – fat from her legs inserted into her cheeks.

Now, further surgery is optional for the mum – as any other treatment would be ‘cosmetic’.

Kirsty has not ruled this out but for now says she feels ‘happy, strong and fulfilled’.

She explained: “When my little girl asks about what happened I tell her the truth – that I was in a horrible accident and was very unhappy for a while.

“I tell her I had to be strong, and that’s what I want her to be. I want to inspire her.

“I also use my story as a warning to her to be careful by roads, and show her how dangerous cars can be.”

Now, approaching the tenth anniversary of her ordeal, the mum wants to help others left with facial scarring.

She said: “I know better than anyone that life is precious, and I want to urge anyone who’s been through a similar ordeal to keep positive.

“Ten years ago I never thought I could be happy but I know everything I’ve been through has made me stronger.”","boorish"

OJ – nicknamed The Juice – was cleared of killing his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman in the most high-profile murder trial in history in 1995.

But he was later jailed for 33 years in 2008 for armed robbery and kidnapping.

Reality TV producers are said to be desperate to sign up the fallen idol once he gets out as it would make “box office telly”.

Interest in OJ’s downfall has never been higher after the global success of a TV adaptation of his murder trial starring John Travolta and David Schwimmer.

OJ was also the subject of OJ: Made In America, a 2016 TV documentary series which won an Oscar last month.

After Nicole and Goldman were found murdered in 1994, OJ was involved in an LA police chase – played live on TV across the world – as he tried to evade capture.

He was cleared of murder after a nine-month trial, but a civil court later found him responsible for Goldman’s death.

She is forced to watch as her boyfriend is quickly seduced by a woman wearing nothing but underwear – and actually has sex with her on camera.

In the cheat test – totally unaware he is being filmed – the nerdy man enters his client’s flat after she greets him wearing nothing but a towel.

She runs off to get dressed but her outfit of choice doesn’t leave much to the imagination as she dons a red silky underwear set.

The outrageous flirting begins almost immediately.

When the bloke asks what is wrong with the computer, the busty Kim K lookalike replies: “I watch a lot of porn that may be it.”

The IT guy says: “Porn has a lot of viruses and corrupts the hard drive.”

To which the woman responds: “Are you good with hard drives?”

It takes mere minutes for the man to be persuaded into “spending time” in the bedroom with his flirty companion.

“You’re not gonna tell anyone about this right?” he whimpers as he is led to the bedroom.

But the most excruciating moment is yet to come, as his girlfriend has been watching the entire scene play out in horror on a laptop elsewhere.
The brutal test has been set up by the hosts of American YouTube channel To Catch A Cheater.

“What the f***? Did you let them have sex?” the furious girlfriend screams.

“Does she know that it’s a joke? She doesn’t know that you guys were filming? That this was just a test?

“Is she an actual hooker? What the f***?”

She is then forced to listen to her boyfriend and his flirty seducer getting it on.

“That’s like a porn video,” the outraged girlfriend says.

The shocking clip has been seen more than 447,000 times online.

“Regardless of whether they hire hookers or not. The guy at the end is the one who decides how far to take it. Because if is not with that hooker it would be with some other chick,” one person commented.

But another person said: “Are you serious? If this is real and they hired this chick and they actually went that far then seriously consider what kind of people you're hiring.

So the girl does the only acceptable thing in the circumstances.

She turns to her other side, where a large bloke is sitting, and asks if he wants a quick peck.

Speaking exclusively to Daily Star Online, he said: “They are the adult Disney world but better.

“Westworld is an upmarket brothel – so expensive and exclusive.

“Men fantasise about threesomes and orgies.

“And there will be perfect sex all the time as robots will be reprogrammed to serve and improve.”

Hot androids “with a pulse” will be built to “perfection” as they will offer humans the “emotional connection” they crave.

The glamorous cyborgs will have artificial skin, voice and face recognition, gestural interfaces and A.I.

He added: “A sex robot Westworld-style theme park means perfection, fantasy, no STD’s and not feeling guilty of being unfaithful to your partner.

“The sex robot theme parks would be popular because men desire sex and fantasy.

“Men with desire are more likely to pay for it.

Researchers found a lull in sexual activity across gender, race, marital status and age, in a recent study.

The biggest drop was between married couples, according to the study published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour.

In the 1990s the average couple was getting jiggy 60-62 times per year, but that dropped to less than 53 times per year by 2014.

The drop for married couples was even more dramatic, down from 73 times per year in 1990 to 55 in 2014.

Single people are actually having more sex than married couples, although the amount has still fallen to 59 times per year as of 2014.

The study used data from the General Social Survey — a nationally representative survey of Americans over 18 collected most years between 1972 and 2014.

According to the study, Americans have also been coupling up less. In 1986 66% of American adults were living with romantic partners, but this fell to 59 in 2014.

The study couldn’t specify why Millennials are having less sex, than those who were born in the 30s and 40s, but they listed some possibilities.

Americans now have more ""pleasurable options"" at their disposal, like Netflix and cruising Facebook.

Pornography consumption has increased — since watching porn is a typically a ""solitary activity,"" the ""frequency of intercourse is negatively correlated"" with the frequency of porn watching.

""Are they less happy and thus having less sex or are they having less sex and therefore less happy? It’s probably some of both,"" Jean Twenge, the study's lead author, told the Washington Post.

""We do know that sexual frequency is linked to marital satisfaction, so overall if you have fewer people having sex you could have people who are less happy and less satisfied with that relationship.""

A recent survey of more than 1,000 students revealed a third had sex over spring break.

And most had put away at least four drinks before the booze-fuelled couples got down to business.

One of the top destinations for randy students this year is Cancun, in Mexico, where super clubs host epic spring break events.

The Grand Oasis club features the largest pool in South America which turns into a huge dance floor at night along with a private beach.

Top DJs are invited from across the globe to provide the soundtrack to the flirting and fun times.

But why stick to one location when you can venture out to sea – on a boat rammed full of horny students and free alcohol.

While not cheap, the Spring Break Party Cruise features 11 bars and five hot tubs, a winning combination for any randy college boy or girl.

While a number of leaks have already given an early insight into what to expect from the S8, this is the first time Samsung itself has hinted at the phone's feature list.

Now, the official Samsung website in the Philippines has teased what the phone's main selling points will be.

Those who register their interest in ""the next Galaxy"" are offered up a list of features seemingly set to hit the future handset.

Teasing what we can all expect from the upcoming phone, Samsung has confirmed the handset's camera, battery and design will all be upgraded.

According to the official tease, which asks 'What are you looking for in the your Next Galaxy?', the phone will offer ""a superior camera"" as well as ""a premium and stylish design"" and ""enhanced battery life.""

That's just the tip of the feature rich iceberg too.

The manufacturer has also suggested the challenger to the heavily tipped iPhone 8 will also play host to a ""powerful gaming performance"" and an ""enhanced virtual reality experience.""

Although the new design and camera upgrades are sure to grab headlines when the phone is eventually unveiled, its the phone's mooted enhanced battery life that's arguably the most interesting upgrade.

Given that the S8 is Samsung's first flagship phone release since the Note 7 fiasco, there were concerns the Korean manufacturer would be conservative and adopt a smaller power supply.

The Note 7 was hit with a global recall after battery issues caused the phone to combust, causing multiple fires.

It would appear, however, that Samsung isn't playing it safe, and instead is ready to pack the S8 with solid staying power.

A number of recent leaks have suggested that the Galaxy S8 will ditch its physical home button in order to make space for a larger screen.

It's expected that the phone will feature a 5.7-inch QHD display in a body no bigger than last year's 5.1-inch Samsung Galaxy S7.

As well as ditching the home button, this will be made possible by removing much of the phone's screen framing, giving the device a near edge-to-edge display.

Another effect of ditching the physical button will be the need to move the integrated fingerprint sensor to the rear of the device.

This will sit alongside a a revamped camera, with a new 8-megapixel selfie snapper also tipped to make an appearance along with Qualcomm's latest high-end Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM and Google's latest Android 7.1 Nougat OS.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 will be officially unveiled at a dedicated press even on March 29.","geeky"

While one offers more customisable freedom, the other provides a cleaner user experience and guaranteed day one updates.

It can be tricky then to decide which platform to plump for when splashing out on a new phone.

Well, you no longer have to pick, as this brilliant new device lets you run both iOS and Android on your existing iPhone.

The brainchild of Israeli company Esti, the 'Eye' is an iPhone case that essentially has an Android phone built into it.

Although sharing the host iPhone's speaker, cameras and microphone, the Eye is otherwise a standalone smartphone in its own right.

The case, which clips on to the rear of the host iPhone, plays host to its own 5-inch, 1080p Full HD display, two dedicated SIM slots and a sizeable 2800mAh battery.

More than that though, it brings long coveted features to the iPhone, with on-board wireless charging one upping the host handset.

On top of that, an integrated 3.5mm headphone jack brings back an old favourite to iPhone 7 owners who are currently bereft of the traditional cabled headphone option.

A device that answers all of the Android vs iOS problems, the Esti Eye runs the latest version of Google's smartphone OS, Android 7.0 Nougat.

This is core, stock Android too, no unwanted, clunky UI skins in sight.

With up to 256GB of internal storage, the iPhone enhancing Android case also adds inbuilt NFC and infrared abilities to the mix.

The only downside to the device is that it adds some additional bulk to your phone, taking existing 7.1mm thick iPhone's up to a rather plump 13.2mm

Currently seeking backing on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, the Eye Smart iPhone Case won't hit retailers' shelves anytime soon.

Having already cruised past its $95,000 funding goal, however, the innovative device has, at the time of writing, racked up $195,000 in pledges.

What's more, there are still 31 days left on the device's crowdfunding campaign.

With models available for the existing iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners can also snap up compatible cases.

The Eye can be acquired from as little as $95 (£78).

For those planning on snapping up the upcoming iPhone 8, Esti has claimed a compatible device will be available just one month after the new phone's release.

The iPhone 8 is expected to launch this September with a brand new, curved edge design to be joined by revamped cameras, a faster processor and a new iOS 11 operating system.","geeky"

This week is possibly the worst time to buy a new Apple tablet. Not because of any temporary price hikes or faults, but because new models are on the way.

With Apple widely-tipped to launch new iPad and iPhone models in the coming weeks, latest reports have suggested the new devices will drop sooner rather than later.

According to reputed tech blog MacRumours, Apple could even debut its eagerly awaited new devices as early as next week.

Citing ""reputable supply chain analysts,"" the report has claimed insider sources have revealed Apple will launch a selection of new devices in the coming days.

According to the analyst, Apple is likely to debut its latest product refresh between Monday, March 20, and Friday, March 24.

For those of you who've not checked your calendars recently, that's next week.

Originally tipped for a March launch, further reports have, in recent weeks, suggested Apple had pushed the new iPad and iPhone release back until April.

Such a move would have helped the Cupertino company avoid sharing a launch window with the Samsung Galaxy S8, arguably the most eagerly awaited device currently waiting in the wings.

Samsung has confirmed the Galaxy S8 will be unveiled at a dedicated event on March 29.

Although the report failed to detail exactly which new devices would be handed a formal unveiling, past leaks have suggested new iPads and iPhones are on the cards.

With the iPad Pro 2 expected to up Apple's tablet game, on the smartphone front, an all new iPhone SE and new iPhone 7 colours have been tipped to make an appearance.

The eagerly awaited iPhone 8 is not expected to launch until September.

According to past reports, Apple could give its tablet line up a comprehensive update, with a new 10.5-inch model tipped to land alongside refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch devices.

It's believed the new 10.5-inch device will be a super high-end offering, with the sizeable screen squeezed in to a body no bigger than the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro.

This will be made possible by narrowing down the device's screen framing bezels.

Although Apple has yet to comment on the claims, evidence has been mounting that new iPad models are on the way.

In recent weeks, iPad Pro stocks have started to dwindle.

With many models moving to shipping windows of '2-3 weeks', it's been suggested the limited availability points to new models being prepped for launch.

The revamped iPhone SE is set to bring only minor updates while white and red iPhone 7 colours have been tipped to join the also extensive black, jet black, silver, gold and rose gold handset options.","geeky"

Users of sites such as The Pirate Bay have been issued email warnings from their internet service providers in recent weeks, and things count soon be taken a step further.

The warnings, issues as part of the new ‘Get it Right’ campaign, have been sent as an effort to reduce the amount of illegal content being shared online.

Including a mass of personal data, from users’ IP address to the exact files downloaded, and when they were accessed, the email warnings also included advice on how to avoid downloading dodgy content in the future.

The warnings haven’t been as effective as the government-backed scheme had hoped, however.

Speaking with TorrentFreak, one regular torrent site user recently revealed how the email warnings weren’t enough of a deterrent to prevent him from accessing free content.

“I was expecting [a warning] sooner or later as a heavy BitTOrrent user,” he said,

“I don’t think the warnings will work, at least not on a big scale. Maybe they will educate some people who did it by mistake or did it just once, but for someone like me there is no hope.”

He added: “At least the campaign is not aggressive.”

With the emailing warnings failing to have much effect, new research from Broadband Genie has also suggested the campaign is not tough enough on users.

A recent poll by the comparison website found that 72% of people don’t believe the warning letter will stop people accessing or sharing copyrighted material.

Instead, many have suggested stricter sanctions, such as total broadband blocks or the threat of court action, is needed for people to take note.

Of those polled, 22% suggested threat of court action or losing their broadband connection would be a suitable incentive, while 19% reckon cheaper legal content would help solve the problem.

There’s an issues with these suggestions, however.

Although the current warning system is capable of linking infringing activity with specific IP addresses, it’s unable to personally identify any single person.

Currently, the warning notices are sent to the bill payer registered to the individual IP address.

The culprit responsible for the unlawful activity, however, could be anyone with access to the internet connection, be they residents, kids, neighbours or mates who once borrowed the Wi-Fi password.

The current warnings state: “This is a government-backed scheme which aims to support Britain’s creative industry by informing people about legal sources of content, with the aim of reducing the illegal sharing of copyrighted material.

""By sharing illegally rather than enjoying it from legitimate sources, you aren’t supporting the growth and success of the content you love.”

Beyond targeting the bill payer, it’s incredibly hard for authorities to enforce the law more precisely.","geeky"

The 23-year-old decided to pause his transition to male so he could fall pregnant by a sperm donor after discovering his fiancée was unable to conceive.

But Dimitri and his partner Candyce Creekmore claim their “miracle” baby Senna has now become the target of callous taunts by strangers.

Online trolls attacked the couple’s decision – even telling them the six-week-old baby is condemned to hell.

Candyce, 32, from Oklahoma, US, said: “It was all Dmitri's idea. He wanted to carry the baby and now we have this beautiful little girl.

“People have told us that the baby is going to hell – it’s so hurtful. I want to open people’s minds a bit more and to encourage people to do something similar.

“He doesn’t let what other people say bother him. I just don’t understand what the big deal is. We’ve just had a baby and it is such an amazing thing that it was even possible.

“When we were told that I couldn’t get pregnant he stopped the transition. I cried for about two hours because I couldn’t do it myself – I don’t remember that day a lot.

“I didn’t expect it to happen this way but it’s a miracle.”

Carer Candyce, who has two other children from a past marriage, couldn’t conceive due to complications from a previous pregnancy.

The couple first met in 2011 when Dimitri was still known by his female name, but it wasn’t until 2015 that their relationship became romantic when he began life as a man.

The carpenter had been on testosterone for eight months and living as Dimitri since 2013 before stopping to get pregnant via a sperm donation in June 2016.

Dad-of-two Dimitri, who has another daughter from a previous relationship, will continue with testosterone shots and is considering surgery to complete his transition once he finishes feeding Senna.

Candyce said: “It all happened really quickly.

“We were together for about a year and we decided we wanted to have another baby. We were friends first. I always identified as a straight female and I fell in love with him as a man.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/596466/Vitiligo-rare-skin-condition-art","Bullied student flaunts rare skin condition in sexy selfies as she bites back at haters","Ashley Soto was diagnosed with the rare skin condition at the age of 12 when a porcelain spot appeared on her neck.

Within a year, it had spread to 75% of her body in patches.

The 21-year-old used to hide her skin beneath long jumpers and jeans to avoid being ridiculed.

But now she’s learning to love her body by turning it into art – making a world map, flowers and even a Van Gogh painting by tracing her vitiligo.

Ashley said: ""I never realised how beautiful my vitiligo was until I traced it with a black marker, it really helps to bring out the different colours of my skin.

""I discovered after drawing around my white patches my skin looked like a map, which I thought was really awesome.

""From there, I decided to start painting actual pieces - I did a flower one and after that I had a world map.

""Next I tried The Starry Night by Van Gogh, I tried to incorporated my skin into it as much of the painting as possible, it's such an iconic piece that I needed help from my cousin to do it.""

The designs can take up to three hours to paint and outline the melanin-free areas of her body, helping her to appreciate the beauty in her vitiligo.

Ashely continued: ""Showing my skin has made me feel more empowered, I love myself now but there are always days where you're not 100% there.

""I was always trying to find a way to look at my skin in a positive light, I couldn't do that before starting this.

""Now what others would perceive as an imperfection I have made into something more beautiful and made it more accepted than before.""

The condition affects 1% of the world’s population, but Ashley's vitiligo spread from a small patch on her neck to her entire body when she was just 13-years-old – leaving her feeling insecure.

She added: ""Within a year it had spread to every region of my body, especially my legs which was super noticeable.

""Vitiligo appeared aggressively everywhere, my legs, feet, arms, chest and face and the patches range in size, from little ones to big ones.

""Around 80% of my legs are without pigment, I have maybe half-way up my knee, then you can see some of my original skin colour on my back it goes half way up so it ranges in size.""

After being bullied when she wore a bikini, the American beauty hid her vitiligo-affected skin beneath clothing despite living in Florida - an area so hot it's known as the sunshine state.

Ashley said: ""Once while in a two-piece bathing costume, a little girl asked me if I'd taken a shower in bleach.

""I was so shocked that someone said that to me that I cried and cried, I didn't want to have the condition any more.

""It made me want to start hiding away from people and left me covering my skin, as I didn't want people to make fun of me.""

In her late teens, she decided she would no longer be held back by her skin condition started to set herself daily challenges to unveil her skin in public.

Ashley said: ""As I got older, I started to feel more mentally mature and became a stronger person.

""I started accepting myself a little more each day by setting challenges to go outside without a sweater and it progressed from there.

""Before I was on a road to self-destruction and knew I didn't want to hideaway anymore, you have one life and so you have to live it as beautifully as possible.""

Now she's showcasing her skin through her artwork.

Ashley added: ""I will continue creating different pieces of art with my skin and hope it inspires others in the process.

""Soon I will be doing some glow in the dark markings which will be a real challenge but it's very exciting.

""Thanks to doing this I've learned to accept myself more than I did before.""","boorish"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/596136/Lizzie-Kelly-first-female-jockey-Cheltenham-Gold-Cup","Lizzie Kelly becomes first female jockey to go for glory at the Cheltenham Gold Cup","Lizzie, 23, has only been riding professionally for three years after ditching a career in event management to go full-time in the saddle.

And this Friday, she will ride Tea For Two in jump racing’s most prestigious event – and she has a decent chance at winning.

“I always dreamed of riding at Cheltenham when I was a kid,” says Lizzie.

“Some people want to be actresses or footballers, I just wanted to be a jump jockey.”

Lizzie has already become the first female jockey ever to win a Grade One race, the highest level in jump racing, when she won on board Tea For Two at Kempton Park.

And she will be hoping for more success this week as, with many of the big guns already out through injury, this could be one of the most open Gold Cups in years.

Lizzie adds: “A Gold Cup is very competitive and, in a funny sort of way, you don’t know where you’ll end up.

“But, beyond maybe Native River and Cue Card, they’re all much of a muchness. If we finished in the first five I’d be delighted.”

In just three years, the Devon-based jockey has progressed up the ranks as fast as any male jockey.

But Lizzie still gets occasional abuse from ill-informed, misogynistic punters.

She says: “The day I rode Tea For Two in the Lanzarote, someone wrote on Twitter saying: ‘I would back Tea For Two in the Lanzarote but Liz Kelly is absolutely useless and weak because she’s a girl.’

“The horse won by a country mile and I had a bit of fun, replying: ‘How do you feel now?’

“Social media can be really horrible. I know other riders who’ve been sent: ‘I hope you fall off and die.’ There’s just no excuse for it.”

It’s a hard sport – one of the few where competitors are followed around by an ambulance – and you need a mix of brute strength and intuition to keep a tonne-and-a-half of horse under restraint.

Lizzie says: “I can ride as well as any lad. I’ve been riding horses all my life so, without realising it, I’ve built a body that is very strong. I’ve got a massive set of shoulders on me.

“I’ve had a six-pack for the majority of my life because I started this at such a young age.

“I had a fat phase, to be fair, around 18-19, but now I’m very strong.”

While an audience of millions will watch her go for gold, they won’t see that the rest of the year is hard graft and solitude for an aspiring jockey.

Weekdays are spent travelling hours alone in the car for one ride, which might end up with a last-place finish.

Lizzie says: “I might as well live in the car – I actually could move in there as I have so much stuff in it.

“Someone asked me the other day, ‘Is it boring?’ Well, actually, yeah, if you took the racing out of it, sort of it is.

“Yesterday, for example, I spent six hours sat in the car for one ride. It was a good day, I came fourth but it’s hard. Six hours driving for six minutes of excitement.”

In order to get as many race rides as possible, Lizzie, like all jockeys, has to sweat and diet to meet each racing weight.

She says: “The lowest weight I ride at is 10 stones 3lbs and that requires some sweating to get to. I go running in all the sweat gear, like boxers do. I can run enough miles to lose three pounds.

“Every jockey has their go-to foods. I eat a lot of smoked salmon and mango.

“The mango is basically water so it’s easy to sweat out and the salt from the smoked salmon is good for replacing salts and stopping cramps.

“Those two balance out the two key elements of wasting, being dehydrated and cramps.”

But Lizzie adds: “I am not planning on ruining my body just for race riding to the point where I can’t have children further down the line.

“I have a minimum weight that’s reasonable, because otherwise it’s hugely risky.

“There’s huge questions about affecting your fertility. That really rang alarm bells for me.”

Lizzie, who rides for stepfather Nick Williams’ stable, has a few other choice mounts this week, including Agrapart in the Stayers Hurdle and Coo Star Sivola in the Martin Pipe Conditional Hurdle.

“We’re a small yard, we’ve a small team of horses,” she adds. “It really is taking on the big boys on each day.

“If a horse finishes third, fourth or fifth, it still feels as good as riding a winner anywhere else.

“It’s the fact you are finishing so close to other high-quality horses that other people have paid extortionate amounts of money for.

“We just hope they all run as well as they can. That’s as much as your horse can do.”

Earnings have also risen year on year, while the Pound also soared in value against the Euro amid uncertainty surrounding today's Dutch general election.

The jobs boom has also seen a record number of workers employed on zero-hours contracts in their main job.

Workers on the controversial contracts increased by 101,000 in the last quarter of 2016 to 905,000 compared with the previous year.

The ONS said those on zero-hours contracts were more likely to be young, women, part-time or in full-time education.

Other figures published on Wednesday showed that unemployment fell by 31,000 in the three months to January, to 1.58 million, the lowest for a decade, giving a jobless rate of 4.7%, the lowest since the summer of 1975.

Almost 32 million people are now in work, a jump of 92,000 over the quarter and 315,000 compared with a year earlier.

Average earnings increased by 2.2% in the year to January, down by 0.4% on the previous month.

A massive 78% of women would go home alone rather than sleep with a man who smells bad. Men on the other hand are more likely to take what they can get: five in every 10 say they’ll put up with any stench once they have a lady in the bedroom.

Reeking badly was also proven to be a relationship deal-breaker because half of the ladies polled admitted to ending it purely because the smell of her partner didn’t please her.

Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, said how you smell is one thing a person can easily control – it’s a matter of working out your lover’s preference.

He explained: “There’s no doubt that the scent of a lover is a strong emotional and sexual trigger – years after an affair has ended, you never forget how delicious they smelled.

“You can’t really control how you look, but you can control how you smell – and that’s a huge win, as we’ve revealed what the preference is for men and women across the globe.”

Meanwhile recent research revealed the bizarre scent that boosts a guy’s erection.

Ladies may want to brush up on their baking skills because the sweet smell that really get a man going is, weirdly, pumpkin pie.

In a bid to find out which whiffs men find sexually arousing, researchers at the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago studied 31 guys between the ages of 18 and 64.

The men were hooked up to a plethysmograph, a machine that measures blood flow caused by sexual arousal, and asked to breathe 24 different fragrances through various masks.

Researchers found that sniffing pumpkin pie was the most powerful turn on, particularly when mixed with the fragrance of lavender, with 40% of the men being aroused by that smell.","vulgar"

New research shows that intelligent people are more likely to have affairs – and women even more so.

IllicitEncounters.com, the UK’s leading dating website for married people, studied the educational qualifications of its members to see if there was a pattern between smarts and sex.

By delving into the profiles of 1,000 men and 1,000 women, researchers discovered that as many as 76% of women held a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 65% of men.

The site’s spokesperson, Christian Grant, explains the link between a big brain and a bigger propensity to stray.

He said: “Smarter people are immediately more attractive.

“A big brain is a turn on for so many and when you accompany that with a big salary, the allure of success means that smarter people find themselves in situations where the opportunity for temptation is greater than that of their less intelligent and less successful counterparts.”

Education, however, was not the standalone factor when it came to determining just how intelligent someone was.

The website also looked its members to find how many spoke more than one language (20% women, 9% men) and how many ran their own business (55% men, 48% women).

While that leaves plenty who don’t run their own business, 70% of men and 72% of women worked in senior roles in their respective professions, averaging £76,000 and £68,000 a year respectively.

Christian added: “Intelligent, successful people also have the disposable income to be able to afford a little bit on the side, while their important job affords them the perfect excuse of ‘working late’ so they can sneak out for a secret rendezvous.

""They’re also natural problem solvers, better negotiators, and tend to take calculated risks, so, if their marriage hits the rocks, and they cannot – or do not – want to upset the applecart at home, they’ve got no problem in exploring their only other option: an affair.”

If this news wasn’t worrying enough, more women are being adulterous now compared to ever before.

The cheating site also revealed a dramatic rise in the number of ladies signing up to do the dirty.

Figures show that over 35% more women registered in 2016 compared to 2010 and as much as 70% more than in 2006.

Christian explained: “As for the rise in women cheating, you can thank the increase in the amount of women choosing to focus on their careers, with children coming into the equation later in life, if at all.

""With more financial stability, they’re less dependent on their significant other than they’ve ever been, so the risk of an affair becomes far less.""","vulgar"

According to a recent study from Chapman University, 86% of lesbian women almost always reached orgasm compared to just 65% of heterosexual girls.

Researchers also discovered only a third of women climaxed from penetration alone.

Lead study author David Frederick, Ph.D, assistant professor in health psychology at Chapman University, points out that women understand how sex feels both physically in mentally meaning they have a natural advantage when it comes to sexual pleasure.

But don’t be disheartened because you can still learn some of their sex secrets.

Here are three things lesbians know about the female orgasm:

1. Take your time

Don’t rush into things because women take longer to climax than men and they have a higher chance of coming after some foreplay.

Researchers found that 74% of gay women said their steamy bedroom sessions lasted for at least 30 minutes, while less than half of straight women said the same.

So aim to last in the sack for at least half an hour, including foreplay.

If you have trouble finishing too fast, there are a number of tips you can use to last longer bed naturally.

2. Don’t skimp on oral sex

Going down on a woman was found to be the most likely way to make her orgasm.

Research by the Kinsey Institute indicates that oral sex is the best way to get her off because most women need clitoral stimulation to come.

3. It’s all about give and take

When straight couples have sex, it tends to end after orgasm, whereas lesbians know pleasure is a two-way street.

David told Men’s Health: “With lesbian women, there might be more of a “turn-taking” norm.

“One person orgasms and then the other person is brought to orgasm.

“There isn’t necessarily that same ‘one-person-orgasms-and-sex-is-over’ type scenario that you see in heterosexual couples.”

So what can you learn from this?

Try to make her orgasm before you start intercourse – and then focus on stimulating her clitoris during sex for your best chance of mutual climax.","vulgar"

If you have ever been cheated on, then you’d know there is no easy way to find out your partner has slept with someone else.

However, one reddit user has revealed the horrific way she found out her boyfriend had not only cheated on her, but was engaged to another woman.

One Reddit user asked the online community, “from personal experience, what are the signs your partner is cheating?”

Another user, Cursethewind replied, “I got mailed a wedding invitation by his fiancé of four years that I had thought was just a good friend of his.

“That was not only a clear-cut sign he was cheating, but that I was the other woman and in second place.”

Predictably, other users reacted with outrage and the user expanded on what happened.

When they asked if the user thought her boyfriend’s fiancé knew about her at all, she said that his fiancé only knew her as a good friend of his – and that she thought the same thing about her.

“He was careful to ensure that we never spoke long or hang out with each other. I never thought it was weird seeing he knew of my friends but never hung out or spoke to them for long either.

“It wasn't too suspicious because we were somewhat long distance and met at a concert, so we weren't really integrated in the same social circles.”

Cursethewind said she was 19 at the time she found out and she’s no longer too upset over it as “so much time has passed”.

However, she did say that she didn’t tell her boyfriend’s fiancé that she was the other woman.

“I knew it probably would get turned on me. He didn't even know she sent me the invite, she just knew that we were good friends and assumed that it was appropriate for me to be invited,” the user continued.

“I just declined the invite politely, sent him a photo of the invite, and blocked him on all forms of communication.

“Apparently, they got divorced a year or so later. She caught him cheating.”

One user asked the woman whether she thought the fiancé invited her as a way of telling her she knew and to put an end to it.

Cursethewind said, “it’s possible, but not likely.”

“She didn't come off as being the type of person who'd just let something like that fly. But, I didn't think he was the type to cheat either, so I suppose pretty much anything is possible.”","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/596008/What-is-a-blended-orgasm-sex-tips-how-to-be-good-in-bed","This is how to give her a blended orgasm – it will blow her mind","There are two main types of orgasms women can have: vaginal and clitoral.

And while women can have a multitude of other orgasms, like anal orgasms and nipple orgasms, these two remain the cornerstone of how a woman can climax.

Numerous studies and, you know, females, have found that the clitoral orgasm is the most superior of the orgasms as it is easier for them to reach climax due to the amount of nerve endings found on the clitoris.

In fact, 80% of women struggle to climax from vaginal penetration alone.

However, when vaginal penetration is mixed with clitoral stimulation this can produce a wonderful thing: the blended orgasm.

Blended orgams are a mixture of G-spot (vaginal) and clitoral orgasms and the way to do it is to focus on giving her internal and external pleasure at the same time.

This will stimulate multiple erogenous zones and can result in a mind blowing orgasm for women.

The easiest way to go about it? With your hands.

The best position for this is for the man to sit on the bed with his back against the headboard, while she lies on her back between your legs facing you.

Then, begin to caress her until she is yearning to be touched, only now use one or two of your fingers from your dominant hand and focus on her clitoris.

Once you’ve got her going, use the other hand on her internally, female orgasm expert Vanessa Marin told Men’s Fitness.

Try different techniques with your fingers and ask which she likes best.

Or, during oral, while your mouth is taking care of her clitoris, finger her with your hand or even try playing with her vagina with one hand and her anus with the other.

To give her a blended orgasm during penetrative sex, touch her clitoris while you’re having intercourse.

While there are some sex positions that are more likely to make her orgasm, most positions don’t create much clitoral stimulation at all.

The easiest way to add that extra stimulation is to have her ride you and stroke her clitoris with your thumb while she’s on top.","vulgar"

Because, as Meg proved that day it’s easy enough for a woman to fake it.

So how many women really fake orgasms during sex?

The team at DrEd – a British-based online doctor service – surveyed 2,000 men and women across Europe and the US to see how many people fake orgasms during sex.

They also asked the participants how often they do it, why they do it and how they feel afterwards.

Over two thirds of women (68%) said they have faked it before while 27% of the male population also admitted to faking an orgasm.

Only 9% of women said they always orgasm during sex while 44% of men said the same.

A similar figure of men (46%) said they almost always orgasm during sex while 40% of women said they do too, 34% of women said they do sometimes, 12% said rarely and 5% said they never orgasm during sex – compared to 8%, 1% and 0.6% of males respectively.

Nearly one in ten women almost always fake an orgasm during sex, 24% said they do sometimes, 34% said they do rarely and 32% said they never do.

The majority of men (70%) said they never fake an orgasm.

Surprisingly 31% of both men and women said they have faked an orgasm during a long-term relationship and 15% of women and 20% of men said they have faked it after marriage.

The study also revealed the detrimental effect that finding out your partner has faked an orgasm can have on the relationship.

Two fifths of men said they got into a fight with their partner when they found out he had been faking it and 15% of women said their partners broke up with them as a consequence.","vulgar"

In fact, more people watch porn every month than visit Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined.

However, new research has revealed you can split porn viewers into three sub-categories – and only one of these categories are deemed “healthy”.

The team the Université Laval in Quebec surveyed 830 people about their pornography habits and asked the group how often they watched porn, how compulsive their porn habits were and their level of emotional distress while watching porn.

The majority of the group (70%) were women with an average age of 25.

The study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found most porn viewers could be split into three groups: recreational, compulsive and distressed.

Not surprisingly, the category deemed “healthy” was the recreational group. This group accounted for the majority of all porn watchers – 75%.

On average this category watched 24 minutes of porn per week and was largely made up of women and people in relationships.

This group reported higher sexual satisfaction than the others.

Distressed porn watchers made up 12.7% of the population and this group associated a lot of emotional distress with their porn habits.

The distressed group consisted mainly of solitary viewers and watched around 17 minutes per week.

The compulsive group made up 11.8% of the study participants yet watched an impressive 110 minutes of porn per week. This group mainly consisted of males.","vulgar"

As it turns out, the mythical nipple orgasm is a very realistic prospect.

In a new study Dr Herbert Otto conducted research on a group of 213 women and a whopping 29% of them had experienced a breast orgasm at least once.

Herbert said the breast orgasm happens at the peak of stimulation when the sensation seems to radiate from the breasts.

This is comparative to the two main types of orgasms women experience; the clitoral orgasm and the vaginal orgasm, both achieved by stimulation of the clitoris.

Research shows a nipple orgasm is completely achievable as stimulating a woman's nipples causes a reaction in the same part of her brain as when the clitoris is stimulated.

But how do you do it?

Cosmopolitan magazine spoke to two women who had climaxed through nipple stimulation alone and they concluded that it varies from woman to woman.

""I found I couldn't stimulate myself to orgasm on my own; it only happens with a partner,"" one of the women said.

""Just take the time to experiment and be open-minded about different types of stimulation and different sensations. Don't focus on whether or not an orgasm is building; just enjoy the sensations for what they are.""

The women say not everyone can orgasm through nipple stimulation alone and for a partner not to get too caught up in trying to make her climax – as this is a sure-fire way to make the orgasm disappear.

However, the women did agree that beginning with soft touches and a slow progression toward the nipple works best.

They said to use constant suction combined with nibbles, licks and tongue strokes, but be sure to ask her what she likes and what feels good. She could even suck on your tongue or lips to demonstrate.

So start by softly touching her breasts and circle around her nipples and areolae (the part around the nipple). Make judgements on how she react and go from there.","vulgar"

Suddenly you can see an ocean as the camera draws in even closer.

As it gets to the surface, the camera switches to Street View and a wide open expanse of blue water can be seen.

And when the camera pans around suddenly it reveals a group of seals sticking out of the surface of the ocean.

And the space agency is currently testing an electric propulsion system that could take man to Mars on just one tank of fuel.

And now YouTube channel SecureTeam 10 claims photos taken from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter may prove the extraterrestrial life exists.

In several shots, mysterious circular objects are captured on the camera and these are the main area of focus for Tyler Glockner.

“This object on the surface almost looks like part of some sort of nuclear reactor – with these long smoke stacks,” he says in the video, uploaded earlier today.

“It’s been called a satellite dish of some sort.

“It’s an amazing piece of photographic evidence showing these massive installations on the moon.”

He then references a UFO that was spotted circulating the moon in a separate video.

“When I discovered this UFO and this moon photograph and then was reminded about the other photograph – it looks identical,"" Tyler added.

“I think we may have the same object and that maybe this structure may not have been a stationary structure.”

Despite the startling footage, NASA has regularly debunked such sightings as nothing more than people seeing what they subconsciously want to see – rather than what is really there.

And many YouTube users who watched the clip seemed to agree.

“Am I the only one that can't recognise how it looks like a UFO,” one commented.

Yes, that’s right, whether you favour Big Macs over nuggets or milkshakes over McFlurrys, you can now order McDonalds without ever having to step foot inside a store.

Well, assuming you have your smartphone to hand and a solid internet connection anyway.

Once you’ve picked your meal of choice, payment is taken through the app, with users then able to select how they want to receive their food.

Although you can opt to pick up your meal in store from the counter - ordering en-route to save waiting time - there’s no need to actually enter a restaurant.

Orders can also be collected via drive-throughs, or by requesting a “curbside” delivery.

The latter sees a member of McDonalds staff bring your items out to the car park. However you order, and however you select delivery, pricing is identical to as in store.

Sadly, as always seems to be the case, there’s a catch.

At present, McDonalds smartphone orders are for US residents only, and then only in two American cities.

That’s because the fast food giant is trialling the tech across 29 restaurants in the cities of Salinas and Monterey.

If the trail proves a success, the company has confirmed it has plans for a more widespread rollout.

Not just over in America either.

McDonalds has confirmed its intention to bring mobile orders to all 14,000 of its US stores, as well as more than 6,000 outlets across Canada, Europe and right here in the UK before the end of the year.

Building on what is already the world’s biggest messaging service with more than 1 billion active users, the Facebook-owned company has started trialling a host of upcoming updates.

One of the inbound additions being tested, is something that’s long been called for, a new landscape mode.

Amazingly, WhatsApp has yet to let users turn their phones on their side whilst typing, despite having originally launched back in January 2009.

The service’s lack of landscape mode is made more surprising, given that its main rivals all offer such a feature.

Despite rival messaging services such as Facebook Messenger and iMessage having long offered their own landscape layouts, to date, WhatsApp has existed solely in a vertical world.

Although WhatsApp has yet to formally acknowledge the landscape feature, code that would enable the addition has been found hidden within the firm’s latest beta software release.

At present, however, the landscape mode has only been seen in the beta’s iPhone edition.

While it might not sound as big an update as the more than 100 new emoji or Snapchat Stories inspired status updates recently bestowed on the app, landscape mode is something users have been requesting for years.

“All I want is this king of landscape support for WhatsApp,” one user commented to leaked screenshots of the feature.

Despite being spotted, there’s currently no word on when the new landscape mode will be available to users.

Given the feature is currently in the beta testing phase, however, it’s fair to assume it’s mainstream rollout won’t be too far away.

Another change that’s heading to WhatsApp is a return to text-based statuses.

Having been recently cut in order to make way for new video-focussed statuses, the traditional feature will be brought back in the coming weeks in response to a consumer backlash.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/596957/Kodi-warning-10-years-prison-illegal-streaming-content","Kodi warning - Live streaming users to be threatened with of 10 years in prison","The crackdown on illegal Kodi users continues, with those who flout piracy laws to soon be threatened with prison sentences.

At least that’s according to a new campaign page by the Open Rights Group - a digital campaigning organisation that aims to protect the rights to privacy and free speech online.

The Open Rights Group (ORG) wants to change the Government’s Digital Economy Bill in order to make it more specific to current use cases.

It claims that the current Bill features too much ambiguous phrasing that could see widespread abuse of intellectual property laws by “copyright trolls.”

If it gets its way, the Government’s proposed Bill could be used to criminalise all copyright infringements, with the threat of up to 10 year prison sentences available.

Although the Government wants to use the Bill to increase the penalties for those running websites that allow copyright-protected materials to be readily downloaded, the severe punishments wouldn’t be limited to the worst offenders.

Instead, anyone who breaches copyright laws, intentionally or not, could fall foul of the Bill and face prosecution.

Speaking in an official blog post, the ORG has claimed the Digital Economy Bill is currently “threatening ordinary internet users”.

It added that its non-specific wording means ""The offence criminalises infringements where money hasn’t been paid or there is a “risk of loss” - which means nearly anything published online without permission could attract a jail sentence.”

Highlighting just how broad a field this is, it added: ”It could be file sharing, or reusing a Disney character in a gif.”

The ORG argues that if the potential jail sentence for copyright infringements is increased to 10 years, more users could be frightened into paying for content, even if they have done nothing wrong.

What’s more, there is a risk that given the difficult nature of tracking illegal downloads, small time offenders could be hit with sizeable sentences in order to set an example to the masses.

According to the Open Rights Group, the Government has been warned twice that this ambiguous phrasing could help copyright trolls - legal firms that send out legal warning letters to people suspected of unauthorised downloading of copyright works.

With these firms sending mail-out warnings in a scattershot approach, they regularly target those who have never downloaded any infringing material.

However, with threats of court action unless they pay significant sums, many are fooled into paying for something they haven’t done.

According to the ORG, if the Digital Economy Bill passes unchanged, these trolls will be able to send out warning letters threatening users with 10 years imprisonment, increase their chance of success when targeting people with these mass emails.

The move comes as further measures are introduced to crack down on illegal Kodi boxes.

Although Kodi’s content services are completely legal, some users have started using them alongside torrent-based plug ins in order to access illegally pirated content.

Recently, the Premier League gained the right to block entire servers found to be distributing content illegally.","geeky"

Its Windows platform has dominated global computer usage for decades, with Windows 10 having taken the mantle in recent years.

Now, however, the Seattle-based computer giant is facing bad news, with the unthinkable - losing operating system top spot - on the cards.

In its place, Google’s smartphone and tablet-friendly Android OS will soon be vying for top honours, at least according to latest figures.

The latest research, carried out by independent web analytics company, StatCounter, has shown that last month Android came within striking distance of taking the number one spot from Microsoft.

While Windows remained the world’s most popular operating system in February with a sizeable 38.6% market share, Android closed the game lining up just over 1% behind.

Although 1% accounts for millions of users, Android’s new 37.4% is the closest competition Windows has faced in years.

“The idea of Android almost matching Windows would have been unthinkable five years ago,” said StatCounter’s CEO, Aodhan Cullen.

“In January 2012 Windows held 82% global internet usage share compared to just 2.2% for Android.”

Looking to how Microsoft can hold on to its coveted mantle, he added: “Windows 10 will need to maintain momentum in order to combat the steady march of Android across all markets.”

Although Windows’s overall market share has dropped, Microsoft’s platform is still king within the desktop and laptop market, accounting for a staggering 84.1% of internet usage.

It’s the rise of mobiles that have given Android it’s edge, however.

In October last year, global internet usage by mobile and tablet devices exceeded that of desktop and laptop machines for the first time ever.

Adding a further layer of excitement to the fight for top spot, both Microsoft and Google are currently working on new versions of their globally dominant operating systems.

While Microsoft is finalising, ‘Project Neon’, a new-look Windows 10 offering, Google is getting ready to unveil Android 8.0 at its annual Google I/O gathering in May.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/596904/Google-search-history-leaked-revealed-Google-Allo","Google just revealed your search history as major privacy flaw is discovered","No one wants their friends to see what they’ve been searching for on Google.

No matter how calm you act when handing over your phone for a friend to use, the panic that they'll look through your list of past searches is terrifying.

Well, now your worst nightmare has come true as Google just accidentally revealed users’ past searches to their friends.

The all too revealing glitch has been found to affect users of the company’s latest Google Assistant enhanced chat service, Google Allo.

It’s the Google Assistant that appears to be at fault here, with requests for comment instead dragging up unrelated, and previously private searches.

Discovered by Recode, the flaw was found to affect group chats within Allo and could pose a major privacy issue.

“I noticed the problem in a recent conversation with a friend,” Recode’s Tess Townsend wrote.

“In the middle of our conversation, my friend directed Assistant to identify itself. Instead of offering a name or a pithy retort, it responded with a link from Harry Potter fan website Pottermore.

“The link led to an extract from “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,” the fifth book in J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter series.

“The response was not merely a non sequitur. It was a result related to previous searches my friend said he had done a few days earlier.”

Worryingly this isn’t an isolated case either.

Townsend explained how the Google Assistant also attempted to share the address of her previous place of work.

“Fortunately, in this case, it was just Harry Potter stuff. But you can imagine how uncomfortable it could be if something more sensitive popped up,” she said.

If this has got you frantically clearing your search history, settle down, there’s no need to panic.

Having been made away of the issue, Google has already fixed the search-revealing glitch, once again keeping your questionable searches free from prying eyes.

“We were notified about the Assistant in group chats not working as intended,” a Google spokesperson said of the incident.

“We’ve fixed the issue and appreciate the report.”

This isn't the first time Google Allo has caused privacy concerns with the app previously criticised by privacy advocates for failing to offer end-to-end encryption like that which protects all of your WhatsApp chats.

It’s also caused renowned whistleblower Edward Snowden to speak out on its lax security and privacy efforts.

“What is #Allo?” he tweeted shortly after the app’s launch. “A Google app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request.”

While Google Allo continues to face criticism, rival service WhatsApp has recently added a number of new features, with its end-to-end encryption joined by an enhanced emoji roster and Snapchat inspired status updates.","geeky"

The average person feels completely fed up just 13 minutes into their commute, and almost a third of respondents say their daily trek is the worst part of their working day.

Among the main irritations are delayed trains or buses, people who put their feet on seats and 'dawdlers'.

For those travelling in the car to work, others who change lane at the last moment nearly causing an accident, middle lane drivers and those who drive at 50mph on the motorway are among the top annoyances.

Additionally, those taking the train or bus hate standing next to someone with body odour who insists on using the high hand rails, and selfish passengers who refuse to stand up for older commuters.

The study of 2,000 people who commute to work was conducted by working animal charity SPANA, which provides free veterinary treatment to working animals, such as horses, donkeys and camels, in developing countries throughout the world.

SPANA Chief Executive Geoffrey Dennis said: “When taking the same journey to and from work every single day, it’s understandable that these persistent irritations can seem like a big deal.

""During your commute, the last thing you want is to suffer delays or have to put up with inconsiderate behaviour. However, these annoyances aren’t the end of the world, particularly when compared to some of the problems endured by people and animals in developing countries – and the journeys they have to face.

“Every day, many working animals overseas have to walk miles, carrying back-breaking loads in difficult terrain and in temperatures exceeding 40˚C. During such journeys, these animals often have little shelter, water or rest, while they are at risk of being hit by cars and buses.”

The study shows that, on public transport, commuters frequently get infuriated with people who hog the seats with their bags, phone reception cutting out every five minutes and having to sit near people listening to very loud and terrible music.

Other irritations on the bus or train include people who stand in the doorways rather than moving down the carriage, people sniffing loudly or snorting and those who insist on using bad language.

For motorists, common frustrations include the inability to find a parking space once reaching the destination, needing the toilet when stuck in traffic and running out of petrol.

Drivers also get annoyed with others who tailgate, rubbish collectors who block the road and make everyone wait until they’ve emptied all the bins on the street and having to de-ice the car on a frosty morning.

Researchers found the average person feels irritated for at least 20 per cent of their overall commute time, and for 36 per cent their patience levels are even lower on the way home from work.

A fifth of those polled say a bad journey to work leads them to feel snappy for the day, while 14 per cent say they feel tired and one in 10 remain angry for some time after arriving at work.

A third of people say they would be prepared to take a pay cut if it meant they could work from home.

Geoffrey Dennis added: “Of course, everyone has to contend with problems – however minor – at some stage in their working lives, but many people in the UK aren’t aware about the tough conditions endured by working animals around the world.

“These animals play a vital role in supporting the livelihoods of the world’s poorest families but despite their importance, their welfare is often neglected.

""SPANA is working to ensure that working animals have access to veterinary care when they are sick or injured, as well as educating owners about how to best care for their animals.”

Teigahn, of Joppa, Edinburgh, said: ""I felt really shocked when I saw what was written.

""As we sat down, my friend first spotted it and said 'that's rude'. I felt really embarrassed, upset and angry by it.

""What if they'd written it for someone who was bigger? They would feel quite hurt by it and think they had a point – it would scar them for life.""

Teigahn added: ""I'd be excited to go as it was the first time we'd gone on our own and felt really grown up but after seeing what was written I just wanted to go home – it really spoiled it for me.

In fact three-quarters of men (75%) climax almost every time they have sex compared to only 28% of women.

As a result the key to pleasuring women has been hugely debated. Some experts claim it's all about clitoral stimulation, while others say oral sex is the best way to satisfy a woman.

And one bizarre study even claimed anal sex was the most reliable way to make a woman orgasm, with 94% saying they reached climax this way.

But a new sex study has revealed that they key to making her orgasm is all about position, or angle to be more precise.

Getting a protractor out during sex might kill the mood, but having sex at 27 degrees is the key to making her climax (apparently).

This is because you are most likely to hit her G-spot and this angle – whoever your pets size.

Lovehoney sex expert Jess Wilde said: “Men can play their part during intercourse by making sure they hit exactly the right spot to stimulate the G-Spot during penetration - this is at 27-degrees and sex pillows can help to get you both into the optimum pose for pleasure.”

The results are from a survey of 4,400 people by Lovehoney, Britain’s biggest online sex toy retailer, for its Mind The Gap campaign to help more couples achieve shared orgasms.

The company started the campaign after they discovered that 61% of women said they sometimes found it difficult to orgasm during any sexual activity.

But they were pleased to discover that almost 90% of couples have achieved a shared orgasms at some point in their relationship.

“For around half of couples this is the absolute peak of sexual happiness, so we are always looking at ways to help them share orgasms together with greater consistency,” Jess added.

“For women, the key to orgasming easily is to have a strong and healthy pelvic floor, and there are simple exercises they can do to strengthen the muscles in this area.”

Doggy style, which is also Britain’s favourite sex position, is one of the best moves for hitting the G-spot.

Even if they’re not playing away, their mind might be elsewhere. As the study reveals a whopping 59% of women regularly fantasise about their ex during sex.

Comparatively, 48% of men fantasise about their exes – still shockingly high.

A separate study also found that women think about sex more often than they let on.

The research revealed women think about sex on average 18.6 times per day, which if you take into account eight hours for sleep, is every 51 minutes.

One woman recorded thinking about sex 140 times per day which is once every seven minutes.

According to the study, more than half (52%) said sex lasts as long as they would like but the party is over too soon for 23% of men and 15% of women.

Because of time pressures couples have to make do with a “quickie” around a fifth of the time.

The results are from a survey of 4,400 people by Lovehoney, Britain’s biggest online sex toy retailer, for its Mind The Gap campaign to help more couples achieve shared orgasms.

It found that many couples would love to linger over sex for longer if they only had the time.

When quizzed on the perfect amount of time to spend making love, a quarter of couples said 30 minutes.

And 66% of lovers said it should last for at least 15 minutes.

The survey found that 89% of couples have achieved a shared orgasm with their partner during their relationship.

And while we all know guys take Viagra to get an erection, you might not know what the drug really does to your tackle or the rest of your body.

A new study has revealed a surprising side effect of swallowing ED medication such as Viagra – and it can actually boost your health.

Research from Sweden suggests that taking ED drugs after a heart attack may help to protect your vital organ and help you live longer.

Scientists followed 43,000 men who had been hospitalised following a heart attack over a three-year period – and 7% of the lads were prescribed drugs for erectile dysfunction.

Researchers discovered that guys who were taking ED medication were 40% less likely to be hospitalised for heart failure and were 33% less likely to die of any cause.

But how can Viagra slash your chances of dying prematurely?

When the team looked into the different forms of ED medication, they realised only the oral kind called PDE5 inhibitors had beneficial effects on men’s health.

Meanwhile there was no link found with the men taking injectable meds, such as alprostadil.

Guys taking PDE5 inhibitors after suffering from a heart attack were 38% less likely to die compared to those not taking any ED medication or those taking alprostadil.

Although it’s not exactly known why PDE5 inhibitors – such as Viagra, Levitra, Cialis – work to protect the heart, it could be because they reduce stiffness in the arteries allowing for more blood flow to the heart.

The study’s lead author Daniel Peter Andersson, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, said: ""If you have an active sex life after a heart attack, it is probably safe to use PDE5 inhibitors.

""This type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis, and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death.""

Meanwhile recent research revealed 75% of lads don’t seek treatment for their ED – but this is why you should.","vulgar"

In fact, 42% of the men asked said the would like their penis to be considerably bigger.

Yet, while research has shown there are many things women care about more than penis size, a New York surgeon has revealed how you can make your penis bigger in just 10 minutes.

Dr Norman Rowe, a plastic surgeon from New York City has claimed he’s perfected a procedure that can make a man’s penis bigger – instantly.

According to Norman, patients could expect to gain 1.5 inches in circumference as a result – and it could all be done during their lunch break.

“You come in, get the injection, 20 minutes later you're walking out,” Norman told the Daily Mail.

Before now, penis enlargement could only be done via invasive surgery, but Norman’s new method injects one’s own blood into their genitals.

Norman said the procedure is relatively painless – as painless as injecting a needle into your penis can be.

Norman is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and was trained at the New York University Medical Centre.

The surgeon said he was inspired by innovative facial fillers and sport medicine.

He also claimed that the procedure can reverse erectile dysfunction.

According to research from the University of New Mexico, women have a much higher chance of climaxing if their male partner’s body is symmetrical.

The study, which was led by biologist Randy Thornhill, quizzed 86 young couples on their sex lives.

Once they’d discovered how often the women peaked during sex, they sized up the men by measuring their bodily asymmetry – how much one side differs from the other.

It turned out that it wasn’t the men’s age, wealth, social skills, physical attractiveness or relationship style that predicted how often their partner would climax.

In fact only male bodily symmetry was linked with the likelihood of her coming.

While researchers aren’t exactly sure why men with mirror-like bodies send ladies wild, there could be an evolutionary explanation.

In the animal kingdom, body symmetry indicates good genetics and is associated with physical traits like being healthy and strong.

On the flip side, asymmetry suggests abnormal development.

So it’s possible that women are reaching the big-O to increase the chances of being fertilised by a male with strong genetics.

Meanwhile science has also revealed the particular penis size that can give women more vaginal orgasms.

The researchers revealed men with longer penises make women climax more often.

“Research indicates that women's orgasm during penile–vaginal intercourse is influenced by fitness-related male partner characteristics, penis size is important for many women, and preference for a longer penis is associated with greater vaginal orgasm consistency,” the study authors wrote.

The researchers added these orgasms were achieved “without concurrent clitoral masturbation”.

They came to this conclusion after asking women to report how much sex they were having, what type of sex and the effects of a longer than average penis on how often they orgasmed.

After they had the women report on the amount of orgasms they achieved from penile-vaginal intercourse, the scientists concluded the longer the penis, the more orgasms the women experienced.","vulgar"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/598267/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-colours-release-date-design-leaks","Samsung Galaxy S8 release date - iPhone rival to launch in these three stunning colours","Another day, another Samsung Galaxy S8 leak, with today's tease focussing on the colours the phone will launch in.

While a bright purple phone had originally been teased, it now appears that the S8 colour schemes will be a bit more muted, at least on day one.

According to reputed tipster Evan Blass, the eagerly awaited iPhone rival will launch in three colour options.

Lining up alongside the stand black offering will be silver and grey models.

This being a major flagship phone, however, the S8's trio of hues haven't been handed names that are that simple.

Instead, expect to see 'Black Sky', 'Orchid Grey' and 'Arctic Silver' handsets hit retailers' shelves when the phone eventually launches.

Despite its name, it's believed that the Orchid Grey S8 will have a slightly purple tinge to its finish, acting as an alternative to Apple's slightly pinkish Rose Gold iPhone option.

The colours appear to be restricted to the rear and side edges of the phone, with the front screen-framing bezels shown to be black on all three phones.

These bezels have been severely reduced compared with last year's Samsung Galaxy S7, however, with the S8 widely expected to be moving to a near edge-to-edge display.

Made possible by cutting down the screen framing, this move will also see Samsung ditch the physical home button, allowing a 5.8-inch display to be squeezed onto a device with a footprint barely any bigger than last year's 5.1-inch S7.

As a result of the disappearing home button, it's expected that the S8's integrated fingerprint scanner will be moved to the rear of the phone's body, lining up alongside its primary camera.

Further boosting its biometric security measures, the S8 will, according to multiple reports, play host to an integrated iris scanner.

Elsewhere, the Galaxy S8's specs sheet is set to be enhanced by a 2560 x 1440 pixel QHD panel and Google's latest Android 7.1 Nougat OS skinned with Samsung's own TouchWiz OS.

On the power front, the S8 will reportedly run Qualcomm's latest high-end Snapdragon 835 processor alongside 4GB of RAM and a sizeable battery that will look to avoid the same ill-fated end as that slotted within last year's combustable Galaxy Note 7.

For those tired of leaks and impatient for the phone to formally drop, fortunately there's not long left to wait.

Samsung will formally unveil the Galaxy S8 next Wednesday, March 29, with the phone to go on sale in mid-April.","geeky"

Just because you’ve been waiting months and months for the S8 to launch doesn’t mean it’s necessarily going to be the phone for you, however.

Before you go rushing out to the shops, cash in hand when the phone is formally unveiled later this month then, stop, take a deep breath and give the competition some consideration.

We don’t just mean the likes of the iPhone 7 or Google Pixel either. Instead, the best alternative to the upcoming Galaxy S8 might just be last year’s Samsung flagship phone, the Galaxy S7 Edge.

Yes, it’s a year old, and that’s a long time in tech town, but it’s still one of the best phones available, and with price cuts incoming, it’s about to get a whole lot more tantalising.

So, is the Samsung Galaxy S8 or the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge the perfect phone for you? Read on to find out.

iPhone 7 aside, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is the most aesthetically pleasing phone available right now, and a device that looks like the future.

It’s glass front and rear oozes high-end appeal, whichever colour scheme you plump for, and its curved edges give the phone a desirable, space age finish.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 is set to follow in in a similar fashion, with a glass rear and curved sides rumoured to to remain. It won’t be identical, however.

Instead, the S8 has been tipped to ditch the physical home button and reduce unnecessary framing in order to squeeze a much larger screen into a phone with a smaller overall footprint to last year’s handset.

Pair this with new colour schemes - including a tantalising purple option - and this could give it the edge not just over the Galaxy S7 Edge, but any other smartphone going, including the LG G6 which recently launched with a similar screen-heavy look.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is already one of the most visually impressive smartphones going. The Galaxy S8, however, could have it beat.

The improvements aren’t just about image quality and pixel count though, with size and prominence on the face of the device taking centre stage.

That’s because the S8 will give this sizeable screen into a much smaller form factor, giving the phone an undoubted edge.

While the Galaxy S7 Edge featured a 5.7-inch display, the Galaxy S8 will fit a 5.8-inch panel into a device closer in size to last year’s 5.1-inch standard Galaxy S7.

Although bigger, the S8’s screen won’t be visually any better.

Like the S7 Edge, it’s expected to run a bright, vibrant QHD Super AMOLED display with a stunningly sharp 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution.

Given the S8’s added millimetres, its screen’s pixel density will be marginally lower than the S7 Edge’s 534 pixels-per-inch effort, but not enough that you’d actually notice any different.

When it comes to screen then, it’s another mark in the column of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 might seem like a runaway success, but there’s a pretty sizeable catch - it’s price.

The S7 Edge wasn’t exactly cheap at launch, it’s £639 made the iPhone 7 look affordable, but the S8 looks set to be even more expensive.

Latest reports have suggested more costly components and the inevitable Brexit-based price hike could hit the handset hard, with rumours tipping the phone to cost as much as £800.

By contrast, the Galaxy S7 Edge price cuts have already started.

Amazon has already slashed £100 from the phone’s asking price, and things are only going to get better.

It’s not just up front costs that are becoming more appealing, the phone is also being bundled with a variety of free gifts including tablets, VR headsets and 360-degree cameras.

Tesco Mobile has recently kicked things off on this front, pairing the phone will a massive £300 worth of freebies.

If price is one of your main concerns when snapping up a new phone then, the Galaxy S7 Edge could be a better option for you.

Whether you prefer front or back-based fingerprint scanners is a very subjective thing.

Whichever way you lean will dictate which if these two smartphone powerhouses is best suited to you, however, with the S8’s missing physical home button meaning it’s fingerprint scanner will move from the front to the back.

Both have their benefits, and each have their cons, and we’d suggesting trying both before buying to see which you prefer.

Making it easier to say goodbye to a front-mounted fingerprint sensor, the S8 will also add an integrated iris scanner.

Letting you unlock your phone simply by looking at it, this eye-tracking monitor will sit alongside the phone’s front-facing camera.

Is it an essential addition? No. But it's nice to have the option.

Although having yet to be confirmed, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to be the first consumer-available phone to be powered by Qualcomm’s latest super high-end Snapdragon 835 processor.

As well as offering oodles of power, this processor will introduce a raft of new features including support for Quick Charge 4.0.

This battery boosting tech allows batteries to charge up to 20% faster and is currently exclusive to Snapdragon 835 powered phones.

The Galaxy S7 Edge is now slouch though, running its own high-end chip, the Samsung-made Exynos 8890.

Yes, it might have recently been beaten by the iPhone 7 in speed tests, but it will stand up to everything you throw its way without ever breaking a sweat.

It won’t be quite as powerful or efficient as the S8, but then few users will push either phone to their limits.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge currently features arguably the most well-rounded smartphone camera going.

Yes, the iPhone 7 Plus’s Portrait mode is the best single camera feature available, but the S7’s 12-megapixel primary camera is the best at taking your from daily action shots, to low-light image capture without ever coming up short.

The Galaxy S8 camera looks set to have it beat, however.

Although the phone will reportedly feature the same 12-megapixel sensor as its predecessor, the Galaxy S8 is expected to add impressive new video capture capabilities.

These will reportedly come in the form of the ability to shoot stunning 1000 frames-per-second slow-motion footage.

This wouldn’t leave just the S7 Edge in its wake, but every other smartphone ever made.

What’s more, the S7 Edge’s 5-megapixel front-facing camera is being replaced a new 8-megapixel offering, firmly giving the Galaxy S8 yet another win.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 isn’t just shaping up as the best phone of 2017, but one of the best phones ever made.

No, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge isn’t going to become an unusable relic overnight, but the S8’s arrival could make it look pretty dated, pretty quickly.

What the older phone has going for it, however, is price. As it’s asking fee tumbles, it becomes and ever more tantalising option.

It’s still better than most of the other smartphones out there, and if your funds are too tight for the wallet-beating Galaxy S8, the S7 Edge is far more than a compromise.

If money’s no object though, the Galaxy S8 is the only way to go.

It might not have a single killer feature, but its high-end, screen-heavy design and improved power and camera abilities should be enough to make it a must own. The phone will be formally unveiled on March 29.","geeky"

With a number of Premier League football matches already offered in Ultra HD, Sky has announced plans to bring the visually superior broadcasts to Formula 1 too.

The broadcast giant won’t just offer a couple of the upcoming season’s F1 GPs in glorious Ultra HD either.

Instead, Sky has confirmed that each and every one of the season’s 20 races will be broadcast in UHD.

“When the lights go out at 06:00 on Sunday 26th March in Melbourne, Australia, Sky Sports viewers will be able to enjoy the race and every subsequent race in the extra detail and clarity of Ultra HD,” the broadcaster announced.

“With up to four times the definition of HD, Ultra HD offers F1 fans crisper track views, with faster frame rates making the action smooth and sharp.”

Sadly, enjoying the new 4K F1 content won’t be as simple as picking up your remote and tapping in channel 408.

First you’ll need to be a paid up Sky Sports subscriber, then you’ll need to make sure you’ve got a compatible Ultra HD or 4K TV.

You’ll also need to make sure you’re running the latest Sky hardware, with only 2TB Sky Q boxes capable of handling the data rich 4K feeds.

Older Sky+ HD boxes are incompatible with the new service.

As well as exclusively offering live coverage of every race of the 2017 F1 season, Sky will also be the only place to watch every one of the year’s practice and qualifying sessions.

The new F1 season starts in Australia on March 26, wrapping up exactly nine months later in Abu Dhabi.

Although Sky offers the most comprehensive list of live Ultra HD content, it’s not the only broadcaster to have dabbled in 4K quality coverage.

A spokesperson for Premier League said the new powers will allow the organisation to target pirates in a ""precise manner"".

""For the first time this will enable the Premier League to disrupt and prevent the illegal streaming of our matches via IPTV, so-called Kodi, boxes,"" he told the BBC.

Clearly, watching live Prremier League football without paying a subscription is highly illegal and, with the new block, many fans will now have to go through offical channel to watch all the action.

But how much will the block actually cost those used to getting football for free?

New customers who are looking to subscribe to bioth Sky Sports and BT Sport – to ensure you get access to every football game of the season – will have to cough-up some £899 a year.

That works out at £61.75 a month, or some £741 a year.

However, unlike the above BT TV package, it does not include broadband or phone. Virgin TV does offer a bundle that includes both.

Dubbed The Full House Sports bundle, it includes a UK landline, 200 Mbps fibre broadband, all Sky Sports channels and BT Sport channels in HD for £75 a month for the first 12 months. After that, it increases to an eye-watering £106.50 a month.

Meanwhile, those who want to enjoy the football on Sky's latest satellite set-top box, Sky Q, will be looking at a monthly bill of some £49.50 per month.

Or £72.49 a month, after you've added the £22.99 a month BT Sport package to your shopping basket.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/597344/iOS-11-screenshot-alerts-anger-iPhone-owners-ahead-of-WWDC-2017","iOS 11 Screenshot Alert - Rumours iPhone update causes mass anger with Apple fans","Ahead of September’s eagerly awaited iPhone 8 release date, Apple is expected to announce its next-generation mobile operating system, iOS 11.

Tipped to be the star of the show at the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, iOS 11 is set to bring a number of updates and new features.

However, it appears not all of them look set to be a hit with the millions of iPhone and iPad users around the world, however.

With one key new iOS 11 feature having been rumpured, the internet is up in arms, furious about its potential introduction.

Although far from confirmed, rumours have suggested Apple will introduce a new ‘Screenshot Alert’ as part of the iOS 11 update.

Although similar features are already present on services such as Snapchat, this would mark the first time Apple has introduced it to iPhones directly.

Screenshot alerts tell those who’ve sent you messages and images if you capture a screen grab of the sent content.

While most screenshots are innocent, the move would act as a deterrent against those capturing images of messages or pictures that could cause embarrassment to others if shared.

Despite such an addition having yet to be confirmed, iPhone owners aren’t exactly enamoured with the rumours, with many suggesting they would ditch Apple’s phones if the feature is added.

“If iOS 11 really goes ahead with screenshot alerts then I’m officially DONE [with] iPhones,” one user proclaimed on social media.

Another added: “If iOS 11 is going to have screenshot notifications for iMessage I’m switching to Android.”

With no evidence to show the future is even inbound, Apple has yet to comment on the claims.

Screenshot alerts aren’t the only feature tipped to be introduced as part of iOS 11.

Elsewhere it’s been suggested the iPhone and iPad friendly software will introduce extensive Siri improvements making the voice activated personal assistant more useful.

New, one hand-friendly keyboards, improved Apple Pay skills and the ability to send cash directly through iMessage are also set to make an appearance.

With Apple having pencilled in its WWDC 2017 conference to run between June 5 and 9, it’s expected that iOS 11 will be unveiled during a Tim Cook hosted keynote speech on the opening day.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/597310/Windows-Vista-support-ending-April-11-security-problems-expected","Microsoft is killing off its most hated ever product - and it could cause you BIG problems","One of Microsoft’s most hated ever products is to finally be killed off, the company has confirmed.

With Windows 10 now the company’s established operating system of choice, and another major update in the works, the computer giant has confirmed it is to stop supporting older platforms.

On the chopping block is the much maligned Windows Vista operating system that was originally released back in January 2007.

Vista support isn’t just on its way out, it’s already in its final days, with Microsoft confirming it will completely stop supporting the platform within a month.

If, for some reason, you’re still using a Vista-powered machine, the all important date to add to your diary is April 11.

After then, Vista machines will fail to add further updates and will not receive any more security patches.

The platform will also lose update access to Microsoft’s antivirus app, Security Essentials, meaning machines could quickly become the targets of hackers.

Those running Vista are advised to upgrade their system immediately or risk being unprotected against potentially damaging cyber attacks.

Vista was widely criticised from day one, receiving low scoring reviews and failing to grab consumers’ imaginations.

As well as being more clunky and harder to use than the company’s past platforms, Vista also came in for criticism for failing to address users’ wants.

Having killed off a range of favourite processes and apps, Vista replaced them with a mass of unnecessary bloatware that caused many devices to run slowly.

Amazingly, recent Netmarketshare figures have shown that around 0.78% of all devices running today are still powered by Windows Vista.

While that might sound like a small number, it still accounts for millions of devices.

It’s not just Microsoft that’s ceasing support for Vista, either.

Mozilla recently announced that Vista users would soon no longer be able to download or use the latest versions of its Firefox web browser.

This follows Google’s move to halt support for older Windows platforms for its own Chrome browser.

While Windows Vista is on the way out, however, Windows 10 is on the way up and currently powers more than 500 million devices.

This doesn’t make it the most popular platform around though.

Instead, that honour belongs to Windows 7 that continues to power almost half of the world’s PCs, with a dominant 48.41% market share.","geeky"

The Lumos helmet is a simple, brilliant idea that has the potential to make you as a cyclist much safer on the road.

It’s a helmet that has brake lights and turn indicators built in.

Lights on the back of the helmet automatically go bright solid red whenever you slow down, alerting vehicles behind you that you are stopping.

And if you are turning, a simple press of a button on your handlebar, connected wirelessly via Bluetooth to the helmet, starts the left or right side of the helmet flashing with orange lights.

There is also a bleeping noise to tell you have hit the turn button, reminding you as well to cancel it after your turn.

Cyclists should still use conventional arm signals as well, but the helmet gives a high level vital extra warning.

We felt that drivers really did seem to give extra space and we felt much more visible on the road.

Both helmet and indicator controller plug into a USB charger. If you used the helmet for 30minutes a day, one charge would last a week.

We found that a full charge took about two hours.

The helmet we tested was black, but it also comes in white and blue. The helmet is adjustable so it fits most head sizes.

All this tech was hooked up with an IPhone app, and the same can be done with an android phone. We were able to monitor battery power and indicator volume with ease.

Simple.

Pros: Makes cycling safer. Bright and easy to use.

Cons: Heavier than a standard helmet…but that’s a compromise worth accepting.

The security shortcoming, which could affect millions of users, allows hackers to gain access to elements of your account “in seconds”.

As well as being able to read your conversations, the security flaw could give hackers access to your contacts list, photos and videos.

All files shared through the world’s most popular messaging app could also be compromised.

Worryingly, the security flaw can be abused without you knowing.

Those with nefarious intentions are able to exploit the vulnerability simply by sending a single image.

Although the shared snap might look innocent enough, hackers are using it to mask a piece of malicious code buried within.

Once the image has been downloaded, the code does its thing, granting hackers full access to your WhatsApp account.

Making things worse, once they’ve accessed your account, the hackers can use your log-in to forward further dodgy images to all of your contacts, spreading the malicious code wide and gaining access to hundreds of further accounts.

The vulnerability, discovered by cyber security firm Check Point, was found to trouble those who use the desktop WhatsApp service.

It also affect those signed up to the rival messaging platform, Telegram.

Fortunately, having discovered the problem, the security firm alerted WhatsApp of the problem on March 8 and the messaging behemoth has already patched the problem.

“This new vulnerability put hundred of millions of WhatsApp Web and Telegram Web users at risk of complete account takeover,” said Oded Vanunu, Check Point’s head of product vulnerability research.

“By simply sending an innocent looking photo, an attacked could gain control over the account, access message history, all photos that were ever shared, and send messages on behalf of the user.”

Ironically, it’s been suggested that WhatsApp’s security enhancing end-to-end encryption could have contributed to the spread of the attack.

As all messages sent through the free to use service are encrypted on sender’s end, WhatsApp was blind to the spread of the malicious content.

Although WhatsApp has since patched the vulnerability, web users are advised to refresh their browsers in order to ensure their service has been updated.

While security problems have been putting you at risk, WhatsApp has been working on a variety of new features.

With the firm to bring back text-based status updates after a user backlash at their removal, the Facebook-owned company has also revealed it is working on a new landscape mode that will completely change how you use the service.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/597527/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-release-date-slow-motion-camera-feature-update","Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date - This amazing new feature puts all other phones to shame","The Samsung Galaxy S8 is now just days away from being formally unveiled.

That hasn't stopped the leaks flowing, however, with latest reports focussing on the upcoming phone's camera.

While it's widely expected that the S8 will play host to the same 12-megapixel camera as last year's Galaxy S7, it appears that doesn't tell the whole story.

Instead, it's now been claimed that the iPhone rival will play host to impressive new video recording abilities.

Instead of adding more 4K or HDR abilities that you're unlikely to notice, however, it's suggested the S8 will feature video skills that are sure to grab attention.

So, what can you expect? Well, according to a new report from Naver, a news outlet in Samsung's native South Korea, the Galaxy S8 will feature some seriously impressive slow-motion capture abilities.

It's been suggested that the phone will be able to shoot video at a staggering 1000 frames-per-second.

By contrast, the iPhone 7's slow-mo skills currently max out at a relatively modest 240fps.

According to the latest leaks, the new high frame rate camera abilities will be made possible by adding DRAM to the camera sensor.

Used to buffer memory, DRAM is what made it possible for the recently unveiled Sony Xperia XZ Premium to capture 960fps slow-motion footage at 720p HD quality.

Although the Galaxy S8 will follow in a similar fashion, further reports have claimed the phone will use a different sensor to the Sony model, giving it a slight edge.

That's not the only camera improvement the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 will introduce either.

Elsewhere, it's been suggested that the phone's front-facing selfie camera will be given a boost, jumping to a new 8-megapixel sensor, up on last year's 5-megapixel offering.

Beyond the cameras, the Galaxy S8 is shaping up as one of the most impressive smartphones of all time.

Multiple leaks and countless rumours have suggested the phone will ditch its physical home button and cut down on unnecessary framing, allowing a massive 5.8-inch curved QHD display to be squeezed into a body no bigger than last year's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7.

This sizeable screen will be complimented with Qualcomm's latest high-end Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD.

With the missing home button forcing the phone's integrated fingerprint scanner to be moved to the rear of the device, an integrated iris scanner will reportedly be added up front, with Android 7.1 Nougat also expected to make the cut.

Fortunately, despite having already been hit by delays, the Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is now tantalisingly close.

The phone will be formally unveiled on March 29 ahead of an in-store release in mid-April.","geeky"

Thanks to its integrated digital smart assistant, Alexa, it's capable of letting you search the web and solve tasks using nothing more than your voice.

It just got much better too, with Amazon removing the need to actually be near your Echo speaker in order to make use of its dinner-ordering, weather-checking, thermostat-adjusting, music-playing ways.

Instead, for the first time, Amazon has brought Alexa support directly to your smartphone.

The retail giant has updated the Alexa app, letting users direct thousands of questions that previously needed an Echo speaker to compute, directly to their phone.

All you need to do to ask Alexa for help is launch the Amazon Alexa app and tap the new microphone icon at the top of the screen.

Pressing this will activate the digital PA, letting you ask for news headlines, traffic information, or even make purchases through Amazon.

There is a catch, however, and a pretty big one at that.

At present the smartphone-based Alexa integration is available only through the compatible iPhone app. There's no word on when Android support will be introduced.

That's not all that could prevent you from making use of the impressive new features either.

The update has so far only been introduced in the US, leaving us Brits left wanting.

The rollout of the new features started earlier this week, but it's unclear when the update will be brought to UK users.

Although Alexa has been added to iPhones, the voice assistant can't be used as a Siri-replacing standalone service.

Instead, users will be required to physically enter the Amazon app each and every time they want to use it, hardly the most natural or fluid user experience.

While great for those who want Alexa access when away from their Echo speaker, this is just one of a number of updates heading to the platform.

It's believed that Amazon is working on an Echo update that would allow the service to tell different users apart just by the sound of their voice.

Dubbed 'Voice ID' the feature would allow the platform to make personalised recommendations based on the user and allow for multiple shopping accounts to be synced and utilised.

It's also been suggested that the smart speaker will soon gain the ability to make and receive voice calls, helping the system act as a long-range intercom system of sorts.","geeky"

One day you think spring has sprung and the next day temperatures have plummeted again.

But your mood doesn't have to drop with the temperatue. Today is International Day Of Happiness, 24 hours dedicated to little acts of kindness and spreading happiness across the world.

And if your goal is to be a happier, healthier person, these tips could be just the thing you need to help improve your mood.

Here are 10 tips on how to make yourself happier:

1. Connect with people

Being around people who care about you is the best way to lift your mood. Research shows that people with broad social relationships are happier people.

So if you need a boost pick up the phone, visit a friend or simply start up a conversation with someone new.

Having people in your life also increases your feeling of self-worth and belonging.

2. Notice beauty in the world around you

If you can notice something positive or beautiful about the dullest of days you're likely to become happier over time.

Learning to be more mindful and aware of the positive things in life helps re-focus feelings and stops us dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.

So live in the moment and think of something or someone that makes you H-A-P-P-Y!

3. Have things to look forward to

Feeling positive about the future can be a great help in getting through tough days.

If you're feeling down, start saving for your dream holiday or set yourself a fitness goal to aim towards.

If we try to attempt the impossible this brings unnecessary stress, but setting achievable goals can be motivating and exciting.

4. Do nice things for others

If you want to feel good, do good!

Whether it's climbing Kilimanjaro for charity or helping your neighbour put up a shelf, helping others is a great way to boost your mood.

Not only is it good for the people you are helping and a kind thing to do, it also makes us happier and healthier too.

Giving to others is also a great way to connect with new people and create a stronger sense of community - which helps build a happier community for everyone.

5. Take care of your body

Happy body, happy mind!

Many studies show that people who exercise regularly benefit with a positive boost in mood and lower rates of depression.

Improved self-esteem is also a key psychological benefit of regular physical activity.

When you exercise, your body releases chemicals called endorphins. These endorphins interact with the receptors in your brain that reduce your perception of pain.

Endorphins also trigger a positive feeling in the body, similar to that of morphine. For example, the feeling that follows a run or workout is often described as ""euphoric.""

6. Keep learning new things

Keeping your brain active affects our well-being in lots of positive ways.

It exposes us to new ideas and helps us stay curious and engaged. It also gives us a sense of accomplishment and helps boost our self-confidence and resilience.

So why not take up a new hobby or learn a new skill this year!

7. Find ways to bounce back

It's not all going to be plain sailing and life can be hard, but humans are very good at adapting and moving on.

We often cannot choose what happens to us, but in principle we can choose our own attitude to what happens.

In practice it's not always easy, but research has found that resilience, like many other life skills, can be learned.

So next time something negative happens in your life try taking a step back and thinking about the best way to deal with it.

Be kind to yourself, give yourself time to feel sad but try and help yourself by doing things you enjoy and being around people who love you.

8. Be comfortable with yourself

Dwelling on your flaws can be very self-destructive. Try to remember that no one is perfect and accept yourself for who you are.

Once you stop beating yourself up about your downfalls you will have more time to focus on the good things in life.

Learning to love yourself will also give you more confidence, a greater sense of self-worth and will inevitably make you feel happier.

9. Take a positive approach

Positive emotions, like joy and gratitude, are great at the time.

But exciting new research also shows that regularly experiencing them creates an upward spiral, helping to build our resources.

Try focusing on the good aspects of any situation - the glass half full, rather than the glass half empty.

10. Be part of something bigger

People who have meaning and purpose in their lives are happier, feel more in control and get more out of what they do.

They also experience less stress, anxiety and depression.

But where can you find that purpose?

Everyone finds it in different places, so try thinking about what is important to YOU - whether it's becoming a parent or getting promoted at work.","boorish"

Back in the 1920s advertising campaigns proclaimed “Guinness is good for you”.

While they’ve scrapped that slogan, there may be some truly surprising benefits of the Irish tipple.

Here are four surprising facts about the famous dry stout.

1. Guinness could help you last longer in bed

Drinking beer can boost men’s stamina and performance between the sheets.

Contrary to popular belief, Dr. Kat Van Kirk claims sinking a few jars can also give them longer and more intense erections.

Chemicals in alcohol called phytoestrogens are scientifically proven to delay orgasm and keep blokes going all night long.

Drinking a dark brew such as Guinness boosts circulation and gets a man in the mood due to its high iron content.

The Los Angeles-based expert said: “Brews are rich in vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin B and others that have probiotic qualities.

“This means it can help fortify your overall health and be better on your stomach so you won’t feel sluggish during sex.”

But lads shouldn’t prop the bar up all night as too much beer may result in them not being able to perform at all.

2. Guinness is low in calories

If you’re a fan of Irish nectar then listen up – Guinness has less calories than some “healthy” drinks and most other beers.

Although it gets has a bad reputation for being heavy, 12oz of the draft has just 125 calories versus the same serving of skimmed milk (135 calories) or orange juice (183 calories).

3. Guinness can help slash risk of heart disease and stroke

your sex life isn't the only area that can be improved by drinking beer.

A study by Italy's Fondazione di Ricerca e Cura, found that a pint a day reduces the risk of heart disease or stroke by a third.

It suggested that drinking a few brews paired with exercise can help keep your heart healthier and give you more stamina in the bedroom too.

And it seems Guinness is your best choice, when it comes to ""healthy"" beverages as it is packed with rich vitamins and minerals.

""It can help fortify your overall health and be better on your stomach so you won't feel sluggish during sex,"" Dr Kirk added.

4. Guinness used to be recommended by medics

In England, post-operative patients and blood donors were given the dry stout because of its high iron content.

At one stage pregnant women or nursing mothers were even encouraged to sip some Guinness – although nowadays doctors advise against drinking alcohol while expecting.","boorish"

And the secret is much more simple than you think – just get more sleep.

Most adults need between six and eight hours of shut-eye per night, so aim for this amount the avoid feeling sleep deprived.

A lack of slumber can have some bad consequences on your health, such as raising your risk of diabetes, weight gain and depression.

To celebrate World Sleep Day today, here are some of the best benefits of snoozing:

1. Better sex

Spending more time in the sack – sleeping – is the key to a healthier sex life, according to science.

Sleep deprivation can increase guy’s risk of erectile dysfunction because testosterone levels dip when you don’t catch enough Zs.

A good night’s sleep can also boost a woman’s sex drive, so let her catch a few extra winks to increase her libido later on.

Recent research from the University of Michigan tracked 171 ladies’ sleeping patterns and sex drives for two weeks.

When women had more shut-eye they said they felt more turned on the next day, with those in relationships reporting feeling particularly horny.

Coupled-up ladies who spent an extra hour dozing in the sack were 14% more likely to have sex the next day.

The well-rested women enjoyed getting down and dirty more, as well as feeling better genital arousal, compared to those who hadn’t slept for as long.

2. Stronger

The more well-rested you are, the more reps you’ll be able to carry out during your workout.

But sleep deprivation could seriously sabotage your gym gains.

Scientists from Brazil found that lack of sleep stops your body from being able to build muscle and can lead to more injuries.

It is also harder to recover after your workouts because it slows down the production of growth hormones and increases the stress hormone cortisol.

3. Smarter

Getting your eight hours of sleep a night can make you more intelligent.

Scientists at the University of Luebeck in Germany found that a decent night’s kip improved people’s performance on a simple maths test.

The well-rested group were were three times more likely to figure out a hidden rule for converting the numbers into the right answer, compared to the sleep-deprived participants.

But that’s not the only way your brain can benefit because sleeping soundly also helps you be more creative.

Researchers from University of California-San Diego found that REM sleep “directly enhances creative processing more than any other sleep or wake state.”","boorish"

Numerous escort services are still working out of the capital and are just a few clicks away online.

This is despite prostitution and naked shows being illegal in the country.

At Pattaya Gold Escorts, the Thai girls cost 4,000 Thai Baht (£93) for two hours or 10,000 Thai Baht (£230) for 24 hours.

They can travel anywhere in the city – even to your hotel room.

Website Gods of Thailand, which offers a guide to debauchery in the country, has given a glowing review of them.

Recommending Pattaya Gold Escorts, it says: “They only use real escorts that deliver very good service.

“These are legit escorts who are trained to provide professional service.

“So whether you are looking for a quick f**k or a real girlfriend experience without dealing with the hassle of going from bar to bar hunting. This is a good place for you to take a look at.”

Top Escort Babes also offers Thai girls for guys visiting Pattaya.

Juliet, 25, says she offers massages, a full service and a girlfriend experience.

She says on her profile: “I have a gorgeous and fresh look, cute face, baby, small waist and cute body covered beautiful smooth skin.”

But she doesn’t come cheap: 6,000 Thai Baht (£140) for two hours and 20,000 (£460) for 24 hours.

Whereas Galla, 27, is only available for two hours for the 6,000 Thai Baht (£140).

She says: ""I am a very sweet, easy going girl who would be perfect for long-time or just short-time fun if you want a quickie.

""I'm also professionally trained at giving amazing massages so I can assure to leave you stress free and with a very happy ending!""

Of course, many choose to head out and try their luck at bars.

Experts predicted a wet start to the week with 30mm of rain expected to fall — despite the Spring equinox marking the start of the new season.

Widespread rain will wash out most of the country, before showers across the North and West turn wintry on high ground.

And Brits are in for a cold night, with chances of frost and the odd snow shower early tomorrow morning.

Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: “This working week everyone’s going to notice a distinct chill in the air.

“The weather can yo-yo at this time of year, we are in a transition between winter and summer.

“If anyone is out and about very early on Tuesday I wouldn’t be surprised if they see the odd snowflake.”

Temperatures could hit -5C tonight after falling from the double figure highs we have been enjoying over the weekend.

It would make Britain colder than Russia's capital Moscow where temperatures are expected to be around 2C.

The Met Office warned: ""Showers on Monday evening, overnight and into Tuesday morning will fall increasingly as snow and hail, with accumulations mainly on hills but locally to lower levels too.

""Ice is also likely to form on untreated surfaces, whilst lightning may be an additional hazard.

""This may lead to some transport disruption and difficult driving conditions.""

The agency said Britain could see 1 to 3cm of snowfall across many areas.

Tuesday looks set to bring grim conditions with snow, sleet and hail expected to batter Scotland, Wales and western England.

McClelland – a former operator if the NASA space shuttle fleet – made the stunning revelation in an article he wrote named, Alien Disclosure from an Astronaut.

The infamous Roswell occurrence refers to an incident in 1947 where ufologists claim a spaceship crashed into a field in New Mexico.

The US military has always denied the claims, saying the object was a weather balloon.

However, over the years multiple witnesses have come forward to say they saw the remains of aliens in the ""spaceship"" wreckage.

McClelland claims he was surprised when his colleague asked about his opinion on the existence of aliens.

He wrote: “(Mr Onizuka) had a surprising experience along with other US Air Force (USAF) aerospace flight engineers and pilots while on military training duty at McClellan air force base, about eight or nine years prior to his astronaut training.

""He and this group were at this base for specialised training when they were directed to report to a viewing room.

""As they were seated, the room darkened and a movie began without the usual official introduction by a USAF officer.”

Lt Col Onizuka apparently told him he was shocked when the film ""began to show what appeared to be some sort of medical examination room with small bodies laying on some sort of table or slab"".

He added: ""The small, strange looking creatures were humanoid in shape and appeared similar to those described by alleged witnesses at the well-known Roswell site in the Southwest USA in 1947.

""They all had large heads, large eyes, slight torsos, arms, and legs. They did not appear to be of earthly origin.”

McClelland said his NASA colleague then speculated that the footage was shown to them by bosses as a test to see how they would react if one of them actually saw an alien.

The two men reportedly agreed to discuss the incident later but before they could, Lt Col Onizuka died in the infamous Challenger explosion.

McClelland is known to be a dedicated believer in aliens.

He once claimed to have seen a nine-foot extraterrestrial in the bay of a space shuttle and also a flying saucer.

Lajiness was arrested after the lad's mum went to a police station complaining the busty blonde was sleeping with her son.

She has been charged with 13 counts of criminal sexual conduct and one of accosting a minor for immoral purposes in Lima Township, Michigan.

She also faces one charge of sending him obscene nude photographs over the internet.

His life is not thought to be in danger although his condition is described as “serious.”

Today he is under police guard at La Inmaculada Hospital in the nearby town of Huercal-Overa as officers waited to question him following his formal arrest at the scene.

His alleged target, who is also British, was unharmed.

The incident happened around 1.30am on Saturday.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/598233/Average-length-of-sex-how-long-does-sex-last-for-sex-tips","This is how long the average couple lasts in bed – how do you compare?","While the average man was recently revealed to last just over five minutes in bed, it turns out the average sex session lasts a lot longer.

A new survey from online sex toy retailer Lovehoney revealed the average British couple last 19 minutes – 10 minutes for foreplay and nine minutes for intercourse.

The research revealed the findings after surveying 4,400 people.

Half of the couples (52%) said they are satisfied with how long their sex lasts, but 23% of men and 15% of women wish it would last longer.

The survey is part of Lovehoney’s “Mind The Gap” campaign which aims to help more couples achieve shared orgasms.

The survey also found a lot of couples were time poor and felt they had to resort to “quickies” a fifth (21%) of the time they had sex.

A quarter of the couples (24%) said their optimum time for intercourse would be more than half an hour, and two thirds (66%) said they would like it to last for at least 15 minutes.

The survey also found around 89% of the couples have achieved a shared orgasm and 37% of couples share their orgasms around half of the time they have sex.

However, the researchers said 57% of men said a shared orgasm was a peak sexual experience, but only 46% of women felt the same.

This could be because only 20% of women are able to orgasm from vaginal penetration alone and therefore find it harder to orgasm in general.

The survey asked the participants how they reach the shared orgasm point and 50% of the couples said one partner tended to reach the “trigger point” and wait for their significant other to get there too.

Lovehoney sex expert Jess Wilde said; “For around half of couples this is the absolute peak of sexual happiness, so we are always looking at ways to help them share orgasms together with greater consistency.

“For women, the key to orgasming easily is to have a strong and healthy pelvic floor, and there are simple exercises they can do to strengthen the muscles in this area.

“Men can play their part during intercourse by making sure they hit exactly the right spot to stimulate the G-Spot during penetration - this is at 27-degrees and sex pillows can help to get you both into the optimum pose for pleasure.”","vulgar"

Three of new alien worlds are believed to be capable of supporting extraterrestrial life.

Daily Star Online actually revealed the same facts almost a year before NASA.

But Jewish mystics appear to have beaten us to it – by predicting the discovery almost 2,000 years earlier.

And an Israeli filmmaker has claimed Trappist-1 is really the giant hidden planet Nibiru or Planet X – which is prophesied to destroy Earth.

UK space boffins at Liverpool John Moores University, working with US space agency NASA, announced they had located seven planets in February around the dwarf star Trappist-1 – 39 light years from Earth.

But – in an astounding coincidence – author David Meade said a star called Nibiru with seven planets around it was approaching Earth a month earlier.

Now movie producer and Nibiru “expert” Yuval Ovadia has said Nibiru and Trappist-1 are one and the same.

And their discovery was prophesied in the Bible thousands of years ago.

Worryingly, he has identified Old Testament verses and ancient Jewish scriptures that appear to say seven heavenly bodies will be seen before the Messiah walks the Earth.

Mr Ovadia points to the Zohar, the series of books that inspired the Jewish mystical movement Kabbalah, which is popular with celebs such as Madonna.

The scripture – believed to be written up to 2,000 years ago – apparently says: “After forty days, when the pillar rises from Earth to heaven in the eyes of the whole world and the Messiah has appeared, a star will rise up on the east, blazing in all colours, and seven other stars will surround that star.”

He also says the book Numbers, which is in the Old Testament of the Bible and the Jewish Torah, also says a star will herald the coming of the Messiah.

Numbers Chapter 24: 17 says: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob [a nation of Israelites], and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel.”

Of course, the Star of Bethlehem is supposed to have appeared before Jesus' birth.

Speaking exclusively Daily Star Online, Mr Ovadia said: “We religious Jews go first by holy books, and only after that we consider other books, such as science books.

“Therefore, if the Zohar says this star, surrounded by seven other stars or planets, will show up in the sky and the whole world will see it – and right then is when the Messiah will be revealed in Galilee – so that is what I believe is going to happen.

“We are in amazing great times. The end of this corrupted material world and the beginning of a new enlightenment world of the Messiah is coming very soon.”

Conspiracy theorists have been predicting Nibiru – a mysterious world supposedly populated by an alien race known as the Annanuki – would return since at least the 1970s.

The man who first wrote about it in the modern age, Zecharia Sitchin, claimed to have based his research on ancient texts by two Middle Eastern cultures – the Babylonians and Sumerians.

His followers were ridiculed as cranks – until scientists at the California Institute of Technology found evidence that suggested the prophesy might actually be true.

Astronomers announced they had found evidence of a long-fabled ninth planet up to 15 times the size of Earth in the dark outer reaches of the Solar System in January last year.

They named the icy giant – which takes 20,000 Earth years to orbit the Sun – “Planet 9”.

And – in another unbelievable coincidence – Daniel Whitmire, of the University of Louisiana, claims Planet 9 has wiped out all life on Earth before.

So conspiracy theorists have been warning for years that a giant hidden planet called Nibiru will wipe out life on Earth.

Then respected astronomers announce they have “discovered” a giant hidden planet that could wipe out life on Earth.

Conspiracy theorists say the planet, Nibiru, is actually part of a star system made up of seven planets.

Then NASA announces it has found a new seven-planet star system.

Interestingly, David Meade – the “doomsdayer” who said Nibiru was really seven planets – said it would hit or pass near Earth this year in October.

And – in yet another startling coincidence – Mike Brown, the Caltech professor who “discovered” the real Planet 9 said it would be seen in the sky “by winter 2017”.

Coincidence? Mr Ovadia thinks not.

Like many conspiracy theorists, he believes Planet 9, Trappist-1, Planet X and Nibiru are all the same thing – and NASA is slowly being forced to admit it.

He told Daily Star Online: “NASA in particular, and the American government in general, has been trying hard to hide the existence of the Planet X or Nibiru Constellation for many years now.

“In my lectures for the past year, I have said that the closer we get to the revelation of this constellation in the sky, the more information will be revealed by NASA regarding it – although they would never admit it openly.""

He continued: “They cannot ignore the many photos, videos and other evidence people have taken of it with a naked eye, in the last few years.

“Therefore in January, NASA said that ‘most likely’ they had found Planet 9. Now they just said they found a solar system/constellation very far from us.

“These are all referring to the same thing we are expecting and talking about – Planet X, Nibiru or whatever you want to call it.

“They just reveal a little information, while hiding much more from the public.”

Mr Ovadia predicted NASA and the science community will reveal more and more details as time goes on.

He said: “What NASA just discovered must be our Nibiru constellation – otherwise why would they all of a sudden talk about finding another solar system out there in space? So what? Everybody knows we have millions of solar systems out there.

“[The mounting evidence is] the only reason they have started to reveal, slowly but surely, more information about it.""

He added: “And they will keep doing so, the closer we get to the deadline – although they will never say explicitly that it is coming towards us and that it has any effect on us.

“This thing they will never say, even when the whole world can see it clearly out here in the sky.

“NASA will still say: ‘It’s very far from us, do not worry about it, just take some pictures of it and keep living your life…’”

The 20-inch, 10lb growth was so huge it even had its own blood supply – meaning it visibly PULSATED with her heartbeat.

But the poverty-stricken mum of six, who could barely afford food, had no hope of getting it removed.

That was until kindly surgeons aboard a charity hospital ship offered to take the weight off her shoulders for free.

Mariette, who did not want to give her second name, recalled the abuse she received: “Neighbours told their children, ‘The monster was going to get them’.

“That was the most difficult part.

“They told their kids to be afraid of me and ‘not to get too close to that old lady’.""

Others suggested the soft, fatty growth was the result of evil magic.

""Some people said it was a spell,"" she said.

Mariette won her freedom from the burden in October 2014, after her friend mentioned the arrival of volunteer medics on the African island – and told her she had a hunch they could chop off the non-malignant bundle.

Despite being warned about the possibility of massive blood loss with the tumour's removal, her two-hour surgery went perfectly.

“I’m so happy. I just wanted to be free,"" she said.

“I was waiting for it to be gone for a long time.""

She added: “This is my liberation.”

And – staggeringly – at least two members of the public have got down and dirty on camera in panda costumes.

Daily Star Online watched the bizarre videos so you don’t have to.

The freaky footage shows Kimmy and Nicole trying to look sexy while wearing full-body panda suits.

The kinky pair – who can’t help laughing at the weird set up – also struggle with the logistics of performing rigorous sex acts through the mouth hole of a mascot head piece.

But both seem determined to give it their best shot.

As she squeezes one of the panda hats, petite brunette Kimmy gushes: “We need to make a conscious effort on making sure these cute, cuddly bears don’t go extinct.

“I personally love pandas.

“They are one of my favourites of all the animal kingdom and I would personally be devastated if they went extinct.”

Kimmy dons the outfit and performs a sexy – if slightly creepy – dance, grabbing her boobs through the costume, before going at it with male adult actor Keiran Lee.

Blonde Nicole Aniston claims to know almost nothing about pandas.

But she begins her video by walking on in what she claims is the style of the celibate creature.

The busty star explains: “They shuffle and they drag their feet.”

Channelling her inner-panda, Nicole says: “My crotch is low and I don’t have a lot of sex.

“I eat leaves for 16 hours a day and the rest is reserved for sleeping.”

Two amateurs have also made some panda porn.

The two members of the so-called “PornHub Community” uploaded their personal sex tape using the username “Ourdirtylilsecret”.

The video sees the pair going at it doggy-style (or surely panda-style) on the living room sofa in panda onesies.

PornHub created the new porn category – which has its own tab on the website – to mark National Panda Day, yesterday.

Both Kimmy and Nicole’s videos were set live to make the international event.

But – unbelievably – Ourdirtylilsecret made their homemade porno five days earlier – and may have inspired PornHub to start the campaign.

PornHub has pledged to donate cash to panda conservation projects for every video uploaded.

But it also hopes the new panda porn could be used to get the flaccid furries in the mood.

A spokesman said: “Female pandas – who are sexually receptive only two or three days each year – have a very slim chance of mating with males because of their inactivity.

“To get pandas in the mood again, scientists and zookeepers have resorted to various methods to encourage fornication, including using ‘panda porn’ that helps to increase these cuddly little tumblers’ sexual appetite.

“However, there aren’t many videos readily available and most of them are of poor quality.”

Let’s hope the black and white bears enjoy the new nude shows.

We’re sure some humans with unusual taste will.","dubious"

That's all about to change, however, with 69 brand new emoji set to hit your smartphone in the coming months.

More than just a collection of new smiley faces and confusing hand gestures, the new emoji include everything from a T-Rex to a mermaid.

What's more, new food-friendly options are inbound, letting you better make your dinner requests without uttering a single word.

The 69 new emoji, which will drop as part of the Unicode 10 release, were first officially announced late last year.

This is the first time they've been accurately visualised, however, with the authority of all things emoji, Emojipedia, creating mock ups of the inbound additions.

""These have been created in an Apple-like style as an indication of how they might be displayed when released by vendors,"" the emoji experts stated.

The raft of new emoji, which includes a giraffe, broccoli and a pretzel, will be formally rolled out to iOS and Android users later this year.

A solid mix of fun and functional additions, the new text and IM-friendly emoticons range from a monocle-wearing smiley to a zebra head.

With breastfeeding, rock hand gesture and a shush smiley having also been created, the new additions will be joined by the likes of chopsticks, a UFO and a range of winter clothing.

What's more, the new fleet of additions include male and female forms of certain things, such as gender diverse rock climbers, vampires and elves.

As well as a raft of new emoji, it's been confirmed that 33 existing emoji will soon be update to include versions for both genders.

This is the latest step in a recent push to make emoji more gender inclusive, with pictograms of certain professions such as firefighter or doctor having only previously come in male form.

""More than 90% of the world's online population use emoji, but while there's a huge range of emoji, there aren't a lot that highlight the diversity of women's careers, or empower young girls,"" said Nicole Bleuel, Marketing Lead and Diversity Champion at Emoji said in a recent blog post.

With female farmers, rock stars, astronauts and scientist inbound, she added: ""These new emoji are one of several efforts we're making to better represent women in technology.

""We hope these updates help make emoji just a little more representative of the million of people around the globe who use them.""

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/599284/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-release-date-final-specs-leak-iPhone-rival","Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date - Final specs leak ahead of iPhone rival's imminent launch","The Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is now just days away, and ahead of the phone's official launch, final specs have leaked.

With everything from the phone's camera to processor having already been teased, now it's the turn of the S8's screen resolution to be prematurely outed.

Showing a visually impressive handset is on the way, the leak has also confirmed that the S8 will switch to a new aspect ratio.

With latest year's Galaxy S7 having packed a 5.1-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel panel, the new leaks have shown that the S8 will adopt a 2960 x 1440 pixel WQHD+ display.

These added vertical pixels show the S8 will switch from a 16:9 to a new 18:9 aspect ratio.

Currently the only other phone to have adopted an 18:9 screen is the recently unveiled LG G6.

For those worried about this visually impressive panel eating into their battery life, the newly leaked image has also shown you'll be able to reduce the S8's resolution in order to save power.

As well as its top end WQHD+ resolution, users will be able to scale down the display to either a 2220 x 1080p FHD+ or a more grain 1480 x 720p HD+ view.

It's expected that the Galaxy S8 will run a 5.8-inch display, with the plus-sized Samsung Galaxy S8+ to line up with a massive 6.2-inch screen.

As well as revealing the phone's screen resolution, further last minute leaks have shown off the upcoming phone's stunning new look, and even outed what the device's retail box will look like.

Building on past teases, the latest leaked photos also show a phone with an expansive, near edge-to-edge display that's been squeezed in to a phone with a relatively small footprint.

This has been achieved by reducing the phone's screen-framing bezel and doing away with its integrated physical home button.

As a result of this missing physical control, the S8's integrated fingerprint scanner will be moved to the rear of the device, alongside the phone's inbuilt 12-megapixel camera.

The Galaxy S8 is shaping up not just as the phone of 2017, but one of the best phones every made.

As well as a stunning screen and impressive camera, one that will reportedly be capable of capturing super slow-motion 1000fps video - the phone has been tipped to run Qualcomm's latest high-end Snapdragon 835 processor and 4GB of RAM.

This will line up alongside Google's latest Android 7.1 Nougat OS and a stunning new metal-edged, glass back design that will come in a selection of colours including black, silver, gold and violet.

Fortunately, those holding out for the Samsung Galaxy S8 don't have long left to wait.

Samsung has confirmed the phone will launch next Wednesday, March 29, and come running the company's new voice-assisted digital assistant, Bixby.

It's expected the phone will go on sale to consumers in mid-April.","geeky"

As part of a new feature update, Google is adding a tool that allows users to share their location in real time.

Made possible utilising your smartphone's integrated GPS, the feature is designed to make it easier to find friends.

There could be more sinister uses, however, with suspicious partners able to use the feature to see where you really are, not just where you claim to be.

Don't panic too much though, Google's not going to let people see your location without your express permission first.

When you're been pressured by bae to prove where you are, however, not clicking share is going to seem pretty suspicious.

If you do opt to let the other half know where you are, in a bid to further aid your privacy, the new Google Maps feature lets you choice the duration for which you'd like to share your location.

As well as being able to set a pre-defined time, the app also lets you opt to share your location indefinitely.

It's suggested that users who opt for the latter will be sent emails reminders every three weeks to ensure they're still keen to keep their current location visible to select users.

Google has confirmed the new location-sharing feature will be rolled out to all iOS and Android-based Google Maps users worldwide ""soon"".

Once you've received the update, to activate the feature, you'll need to head into Maps's side menu or click on the blue location dot.

Here, tapping ""Share Location"" will let you do just that, picking who you want to make your location visible to, and how long you'd like to let them know your whereabouts.

You'll be able to share your location with existing Google contacts, or with friends using popular messaging services such as text or WhatsApp.

Those who receive your location will be able to track you in real time using their own Google Maps app, their mobile browser on via their internet-connected computer.

""When you're sharing your location, the people you've chosen to share with will see you on their map,"" Google explained in unveiling the feature.

""You'll see an icon above the compass on your own map reminding you that you're actively sharing your location.

""You can change your mind and stop sharing at any time - it's entirely up to you.""

This new device keeps its classic styling but has had a few upgrades squeezed inside its aluminium shell.

These updates include a speed bump with the faster A9 processor now powering this tablet and a brighter 9.7-inch Retina display bringing an improved visual experience.

Along with these changes the new iPad has all the usual features such as a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and front and rear cameras.

There is good news if you fancy buying one of these tablets as they will be availble to order soon and will land in your hand at a much lower price.

The older iPad Air 2 currently costs around £379 but the new iPad has a starting price of £339.

“iPad is the world’s most popular tablet. Customers love the large, 9.7-inch display for everything from watching TV and movies, to surfing the web, making FaceTime calls, and enjoying photos, and now it is even more affordable,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.

“New customers and anyone looking to upgrade will love this new iPad for use at home, in school, and for work, with its gorgeous Retina display, our powerful A9 chip, and access to the more than 1.3 million apps designed specifically for it.”

The news of the iPad update comes as Apple also revealed a new iPhone.

In recognition of more than 10 years of partnership between Apple and (RED), the iPhone 7 now comes in a stunning new colour.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/598951/Sky-Q-news-update-voice-search","Your Sky box just got a MASSIVE update here's how to use the biggest and best new feature","Fans of Sky have some new features coming to their set-top box today.

The satellite TV firm has just announced the launch of a major update to its Sky Q service which now means users can search for shows via the power of their voice.

Sky Q launched in 2016 allowing users to record more shows at once and wirelessly stream content to other rooms via the new mini boxes.

Voice search was announced at the launch of Sky Q but it wasn't available when the devices began arriving in homes last year.

However, this major update now brings voice activation to Sky Q.

From today, Sky Q users can now ask their next-generation set-top box to take them to movies, like ""Zootropolis"", or television seasons by saying the name of the show, like ""Billions"".

Best of all, you don't even have to be that specific – with customers able to ask for the new ""Liverpool game"" to be taken to the next Premier League fixture.

Sky has also programmed some nice Easter eggs into the new functionality.

For example, movie buffs can search the Sky Cinema catalogue using some of cinema's most iconic quotes, including “Say hello to my little friend” and “I'll have what she's having"".

It's also possible to narrow your searches using other criteria, including asking for ""something new"", a specific film genre, the age of the movie – or even it's star rating.

Alongside voice search, a collection of features will also roll out to Sky Q including:

· My Q: The My Q section becomes the new Sky Q homepage. With customers wanting even more personalisation and advice on the best new shows, it will feature recommendations based on household viewing and top new series from all channels across Sky Q.

And the Continue Watching section will allow customers to pick up where they left off from an episode in a series such as Game of Thrones and Fortitude.

Plus navigation is simpler, with Recordings and TV Guide only a swipe away from the new My Q homepage

· Facebook videos: Now watch Facebook videos with the current My Photos application, and bring friends and family together to share Facebook memories on the big screen at home. Customers can use the My Photos App on Sky Q to sign into their Facebook profile and see their latest photos and videos

Luke Bradley-Jones, Sky’s brand director of TV and content products, commented: “May the force be with you” with your new voice search. Just ask Sky Q to “show me the money” by pressing the side of the touch remote, making it even easier and faster to find, discover and watch the TV you love.”

Along with this update Sky recently announced that every one of the 2017 F1 season’s 20 races will be broadcast in UHD.

As well as exclusively offering live coverage of every race Sky will also be the only place to watch every one of the year’s practice and qualifying sessions.

The new F1 season starts in Australia on March 26, wrapping up exactly nine months later in Abu Dhabi.

Although Sky offers the most comprehensive list of live Ultra HD content, it’s not the only broadcaster to have dabbled in 4K quality coverage.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/598291/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-price-release-date-leaks-iPhone-rival-cost","Samsung Galaxy S8 Price - iPhone rival's price confirmed, and it's not coming cheap","With the Samsung Galaxy S8 release date now just days away, attention is turning from not what the phone will offer, but how much it will cost.

A number of Galaxy S8 leaks have surfaced in recent weeks and months, outing virtually every aspect of the upcoming device's design and specs sheet.

One thing that's remained largely illusive, however, is how much the phone will cost.

Until now that is. The S8's asking price has now appeared online, and it would seem that the phone's going to be anything but cheap.

Surfacing via reputed Twitter-based tech tipster Evan Blass, it's been suggested that the cheapest Galaxy S8 handset available will set wannabe owners back a lofty €799.

For those after the larger, Samsung Galaxy S8+, they'll reportedly have to part with a massive €899 of their hard earned cash.

Although UK pricing has yet to be confirmed, direct conversions from Euros - not the most accurate relation of price - would peg the upcoming phones with £692 and £779 asking prices respectively.

By contrast, the base level iPhone 7 currently costs €759 on the continent, £599 here in the UK, with the larger iPhone 7 Plus starting at €899, £719.

While many will scoff at such a steep asking price, the phone's lofty fee will be offset by a groundbreaking array of high-end internals.

It's expected that the S8 will pair Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM and a sizeable battery that will look to avoid the same combusting woes as last year's Galaxy Note 7.

Elsewhere the phone is set to run Google's latest Android 7.1 Nougat OS.

This will reportedly be skinned with a new version of Samsung's much loved TouchWiz user interface.

What will really set the S8 apart from the likes of the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, however, will be its design and screen.

That's because the phone's 5.8-inch screen will account for much of the phone's front with a the sizeable panel to be squeezed into a device with an overall footprint barely any bigger than last year's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7.

This will be made possible by reducing the framing from around the phone's QHD panel, removing the physical home button and moving the phone's integrated fingerprint scanner to the rear of the device.

Pleasingly, those holding out for the Galaxy S8 don't have long left to wait.

Samsung has confirmed that the S8 will be formally unveiled at a dedicated Unpacked event on March 29 with the phone to hit retailers' shelves in mid-April.","geeky"

Echoing the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon, the Korean tech giant has unveiled its own voice controlled digital assistant.

Dubbed Bixby, the new Samsung smartphone focussed voice assistant is aimed at making users' phones more accessible and easier to use.

Although the phone has yet to be formally unveiled, Samsung has confirmed that Bixby will make its debut on the S8 when the eagerly awaited phone is formally unveiled next week.

Unlike Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, Bixby will be focussed more on improving usability of the host devices' features than acting as a way of controlling your plethora of smart home devices or searching the web using nothing but your voice.

""Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, but as the capabilities of machines such as smartphones, PCs, home appliances and IoT devices become more diverse, the interfaces on these devices are becoming too complicated for users to take advantage of these many functions conveniently,"" InJong Rhee, Samsung's Executive Vice President and Head of R&D for Software and Services said in unveiling the new service.

""Instead of humans learning how a machine interacts with the world, it is the machine that needs to learn and adapt to us.

""With this new approach, Samsung has employed artificial intelligence, reinforcing deep learning concepts to the core of our user interface designs. Bixby is the ongoing result of this effort.""

Although teasing the software ahead of the S8's formal unveiling, Samsung has revealed that Bixby will be severely limited at launch.

Like Siri, which launched in Beta mode, Bixby will work with only a small collection of specially prepared apps.

Further support and more cross-device collaboration will be introduced further down the line as the platform continues to adapt and evolve, the Korean manufacturer has confirmed.

""There has been a lot of excitement and speculation about what we will deliver with the launch of the Galaxy S8 later this month, especially due to the advancements in artificial intelligence,"" Rhee said.

""We do have a bold vision of revolutionising the human-to-machine interface, but that vision won't be realised overnight. Ambition takes time.""

Instead, Samsung has claimed that Bixby ""will be our first step on a journey to completely open up new ways of interacting with your phone.""

While a handful of Bixby-enabled applications will come preinstalled on the Galaxy S8, Samsung says it will ""eventually"" release an SDK that allows developers and third-party manufacturers build Bixby support into their own devices and services.

Contextually aware, Bixby will be triggered by on screen commands or using the dedicated physical Bixby button that will be built into the side of future compatible devices, including the upcoming Galaxy S8.

Already looking to the future of the platform, Samsung has suggested the voice assistant will quickly evolve beyond the smartphone to control further aspect of your life.

The collection of apps set to gain Bixby support is currently unclear, but will be confirmed alongside the Galaxy S8's unveiling next Wednesday, March 29.","geeky"

If you haven’t had time to grab a present for Mother’s Day this Sunday yet, perhaps you should swing by your local Aldi.

The cut-price giant has launched the ultimate parent-pampering package which is a whopping 69% cheaper than supermarket rivals.

Aldi’s gift bundle includes a bunch of flowers (£3.49), luxury chocolates (£4.99), a bottle of Pata Negra Cava Rosada (£5.99) and a card (79p) – meaning the whole lot will cost you just £15.29.

You’ll be saving cash by heading to the discount retailer rather than shopping at other stores.

Aldi revealed a similar package would set you back £49.50 at M&S and £34.98 at Waitrose.

This school takes the children no-one else can deal with, because of their tough home life, bad behaviour or learning difficulties.

And using the boxing skills of focus and discipline, staff are helping the students turn their lives around.

Head teacher Anna Cain says: “These are the children everyone wrote off. The ones other schools said couldn’t be taught.

“The mainstream has failed them. We have 40 children here and all of them have been referred here in some way or another due to violent or aggressive behaviour.

“That means other places won’t take them, but where do they go? They are not bad kids, they have just had some bad experiences.”

The Boxing Academy, in Hackney, east London, is a working school of 14 to 16-year-olds which combines the usual lessons such as English and Maths with daily boxing training.

Each pod – or class – has eight children and a boxer as the leader who builds a relationship with each child.

Good performance is rewarded with prizes and rule breaking is not tolerated.

For example, anyone turning up late has to do push-ups – without exception.

Boxing is part of the curriculum and is taught to the highest standard, and all the kids get a coaching qualification at the end of their two years.

Anna says: “It’s a fresh start and part of it is accepting we are not going to tolerate bad behaviour. And in most cases they will turn it around themselves.

“I have yet to meet a child who doesn’t want to be successful – they just don’t know how to.

“Boxing calms people down. We know this works.”

There are plenty of success stories in this school’s 10-year history.

For instance, one former pupil is in his second year of an accountancy degree.

And in this academic year, there are plenty of pupils hoping to emulate that success.

Hackney lad Kenan, 14, finds boxing helps him channel his energy.

He says: “It helps you focus and you can take out all your anger in the boxing ring.

“At my old school I was rude to every teacher and felt a lot of anger but I can get rid of it all when I box.

“I like the lessons as well and I feel I’ve really changed.”

Jake, 15, adds: “This has been a big opportunity for me. I got into a lot of trouble before but I am much happier here.”

Martell, 15, from Haringey, north London, says: “I’m leaving in June. I would like to do an apprenticeship. I’m a musician and interested in music and media so hopefully I can work in that.

“My previous school wasn’t very good for me and I didn’t do well, but it has been so much better here.”

Camron, 15, from Islington, north London, is one of only five girls in the school.

But while she thinks the boys are “annoying”, being female has not held her back here.

She says: “The way they teach you helps change your attitude and the way you speak to people.

“My family all say I am a better person since coming here.

“And I feel a lot calmer and happier.”

Camron is hoping to go to college when she leaves The Boxing Academy and dreams of starting a career in beauty.

Jermaine Williams, 27, is head of boxing and has been working at the academy for seven years.

After getting in trouble himself as a teenager, he understands all too well the huge challenges and struggles today’s young people face.

“I had a group of friends I hung round with who were bad influences on me,” he explains.

“I wouldn’t say we were a gang but that is how some people could have seen us.

“They became my family because I did not have that support at home – and we did bad things.

“I spent time on remand and was going down the wrong path before I turned things around.

“Working here gives me the chance to give back and help young people.

“I didn’t have anyone to give me guidance so I want to do that for these kids.”

Yilmaz Mustafa, 27, is a senior pod leader and has been boxing for 19 years.

“People who don’t know about boxing think we are crazy teaching them to fight,” he says.

“But it teaches focus and discipline and helps in every aspect of their lives.

“A lot of people can’t handle dealing with these kids.

“You need patience and the ability to know what is the right thing to say and do at any time.

“It’s really rewarding to see the looks on their faces when they get their GCSE results.”

Ahead of Red Nose Day tomorrow, head teacher Anna wants people to realise that their donations are crucial to projects like this.

She says: “We wouldn’t be here today without Comic Relief money. These are the kids who would have gone very badly wrong very quickly.”

The 50-year-old was so ashamed that she’d sworn off sex for seven years.

Finally in 2007 she was referred for an operation to lift her prolapsed bladder using a plastic mesh sling called a transvaginal tape (TVT) to stop her leaking.

The surgery worked and sex was better than ever – until two years later when she almost sliced off the end of her partner’s penis.

Theresa, from Brighton, said: “It was like it had grown teeth.

“His willy was bright red and spouting blood. There was a big red stain spreading between us on the sheets.

“After that he was scared of my lady garden and approached it as if it was a Venus flytrap.”

Theresa said the operation – which was supposed to boost her sex life – left her vagina with “teeth” that “bit” her lover’s manhood.

She was sure her fella’s gory injury had been caused by the mesh she could feel inside her. But every time she saw her doctor she was assured it was working just fine.

Theresa and her partner avoided sex because they were too scared to try again – and six months later they ended up splitting.

Fearful of getting intimate with anyone new, as she didn’t want to risk injuring them, her confidence yet again hit rock bottom.

Theresa went on a diet and started exercising, transforming her physique and dropping from a size 20 to a size 14.

Her operation involved having a plastic mesh sling called a transvaginal tape (TVT) inserted to lift her prolapsed bladder and stop her leaking.

In TVT surgery, a mesh tape is placed under your urethra like a sling or hammock to keep it in its normal position.

The tape is inserted through tiny incisions in your abdomen and vaginal wall, with the procedure normally taking around 30 minutes.

Around 13,500 women have the operation annually on the NHS and it’s the most common way to treat stress incontinence.

Theresa read up on complications with the op, which had caused the it to be banned elsewhere in the UK.

There has been an increase in the women coming forward with post-op problems, leading it to be suspended in ­Scotland two years ago, where around 400 lawsuits are ongoing.

The mum-of-one had been noticing a decline in her general health and visited her GP, where she was diagnosed with IBS and later prescribed antidepressants.

Over the next few years she had her gallbladder removed and saw 25 different doctors, but she was still concerned that her problems stemmed from her mesh.

But it wasn’t until 2015, when her vagina began leaking green puss and emitting a foul smell, that she was properly examined.

A consultant told her the mesh needed to be removed urgently. It had eroded through the belly button side of her vaginal wall, causing her to grow an abscess which had become infected and turned septic.

Then in November 2015 it was removed in a complicated operation. The mesh had secured itself with cartilage to her pelvis, first shrinking then turning hard.

Theresa said: “It felt like razor-sharp teeth, hence why it had ripped a chunk from my boyfriend’s willy.”

She was finally told the mesh had been fitted too low, which is why she had injured her partner’s penis and suffered such awful complications.

The removal left her completely incontinent and her vagina is now numb.

At just 50-years-old, she fears she will remain celibate forever.

She said: “I was told this simple procedure would cure my incontinence and give me more confidence on the bedroom, but it has ruined my life.”

Theresa is currently campaigning to have the treatment banned across the country.","boorish"

Khalid Masood's ISIS-inspired hit on the country’s capital could spark a domino effect similar to the one felt in France.

Five people died after the crazed jihadist rammed a car through dozens of people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer outside Parliament building.

Now Chris Phillips, the former head of National Counter Terrorism Security Office, fears Wednesday’s attack could just be the start and ""there could be five attacks tomorrow"".

Getty

“If you think back to Paris, it was attack after attack,” he told Daily Star Online. “Not just (in) London, the UK.

“The next attack may be something completely different, maybe a suitcase bomb at an airport, or someone trying to attack an airplane. It’s a big subject with lots of options.

“The fact is you do have copycats.”

Phillips, a former police officer, warns that the threat of Europe facing further terror in the near future is very possible.

“It’s up to the terrorist when they want to do it - they only have to get into a car,” he added.

Despite heightened security, the expert says police officers “can’t keep that up for ever”.

He adds: “Look at the emergency services in Paris, they’ve tried to keep it up for 15 months now, you can’t maintain that, it doesn’t work.

“(Londoners) are going to see more police officers (in the coming days), more overhead searching, firearms officers at train stations etcetera.

“There are not enough police officers in the UK to keep that up for too long.

“(And) it’s just human nature that in a month’s time everyone will go back to their normal complacent selves.

“If you’re a terrorist, what you would do is say ‘I’ll keep low for a couple of weeks and then I’ll do it when it all calms down again, and then I’ll get in a car…”

“It’s a very difficult situation for the police.”

The attack came on the anniversary of the Brussels attack in Belgium – where another atrocity was foiled in Antwerp today.

Phillips says the danger of British jihadists returning home to wreak terror on our streets is one of the country’s biggest threats.

“We’ve known for some time now that there’s an enormous amount of people coming back from Syria and Iraq that have been involved in terrorism, fighting and killing people,” he added.

“You only need one or two of those to go bad and then we’re in trouble.

“Some of them may think ‘I don’t want to get involved’, others may think ‘I believe in the cause, I’m going to do something’.

“There are also people being released from prison on terrorism offences (that present a risk).”

Another security expert Will Geddes, head of International Corporate Protection (ICP), said the work to cut off links to prevent further attacks has just begun.

He told us: ""What the security services will be doing being the scenes will be immense.

“Collecting evidence, identifying the individual, tracking his digital records, communications.

“Is he part of a bigger group? What motivated and what influenced him?

“This is not only useful to this case, but it’s also a big asset for future counter-terrorism knowledge.”

He added: “It definitely appears to have been a directed attack with three key objectives.

“One, to hit a building of the state. Two, to target an identifiable building, arguably one the most recognisable in London. Three, it was also an attack on the international community with several French students injured.

“This ticks all the boxes for what a terrorist would want to achieve.”

Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has asked the British public to remain vigilant with ""lone wolf attacks"" difficult to predict.

Mr Fallon told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This kind of attack, this lone wolf attack, using things from daily life – a vehicle, a knife – is much more difficult to forestall.

“We are also dealing with a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage, but simply wants to kill as many people as possible – so this is a new element to international terrorism.

“This is a new type of attack where somebody gets hold of a vehicle and drives it into innocent people – that also shows the moral vacuity of these terrorists.”","dramatic"

When advertised, the property was listed as a student flat with six bedrooms and in a good location for transport into the city centre.

Images from inside show a sparse flat, with neutral colours and decoration.

Masood changed his name from Adrian Elms and moved to Birmingham after undergoing a religious conversion in prison.

After serving time for stabbing a 22-year-old man in the face, Masood became an English teacher and took up bodybuilding.

Yesterday, a Brit – now named as Khalid Masood – mowed down dozens of people in his Hyundai 4x4 before stabbing a police officer with a machete outside Parliament building.

Five people have died and more than 20 were injured.

Speaking on Sage of Quay Radio on March 21, the Denmark-born researcher appeared to predict London was next.

He said: “Should there be a hit against Big Ben let it be known that this was pointed out before hand.”

As evidence he pointed to an incident at Flinders train station in Melbourne where a car drove into pedestrians leaving four dead and 20 injured.

In a video he said that there is a clock on the building which is very similar to the Big Ben clock tower.

The presenter then asked: “But you’re saying specifically Big Ben?”

Ole replied: “I’m just saying, that’s where the camera is focussed on right before it actually happens…”

He adds: “In that first few seconds where you mind is thinking ‘what’s going to happen?’ you’re looking straight at that tower, and then boom”.

Although the attack on pedestrians in Melbourne was not regarded as terrorist related by cops, many people online were shocked at the apparently accurate prediction.

Tributes have been coming in from all over the world for the victims of the attack in the heart of central London.

Horrific pictures from the scene show the trail of devastation left after a 4x4 mounted the curb and ploughed into pedestrians.

Anti-terror cops have arrested eight people and have said the attacker is 52-year-old Khalid Masood, a British-born man living in Birmingham.

Ole is a researcher who reportedly believes that a small number of people are behind the strife of the modern world.

As well as being highly involved in investigating conspiracy theories, he has also done extensive research into terror attacks around the world.

After the Brussels bombings he offered his own unique insights, as well as taking on research into the Norway terror attack in 2011.

But the match did not end there.

Mankind miraculously dragged himself off a stretcher as he was being carried away by medics and returned to the top of the cell only to be thrown off again.

Mr Justice Green severely criticised Sussex Police as he jailed Michael Lane for a minimum 25 years after being found guilty of murdering Shana.

The judge told Lewes Crown Court: “She was treated as the wrongdoer and Michael Lane was treated as the victim.

“There was seemingly no appreciation that a young woman in a sexual relationship could be vulnerable and at risk of serious harm.

“The police jumped to conclusions and Shana was stereotyped.”

While the clitoral is a lot easier to achieve for most women, the vaginal, or G-spot orgasm is the elusive O we are always trying to reach.

The G-spot is a small, spongy area located around two or three inches into the vagina on the front vaginal wall.

So fellas who like to use jelqing – a dangerous technique to make your penis longer – need not as your penis doesn’t need to be that long to give her one of these orgasms.

However, the G-spot orgasm doesn’t come easy.

In fact, 80% of women have trouble reaching intercourse from vaginal intercourse alone.

Yet, there are some steps you can take to heighten both of your chances of giving her a G-spot orgasm and along with steps, there are four specific positions that are most likely to tip her over the edge.

1. Girl on top

When the girl is on top, if she tilts her body back slightly this allows the pressure of his penis to push up against her vaginal wall which is where the G-spot is located.

2. Doggy style

The best position for achieving that elusive orgasm, the UK’s favourite sex position allows the man to penetrate deeper than most other positions

3. The Anvil

The anvil is perfect for women who like to be dominated during sex. The women needs to lie on her back, raise her legs in the air and use her hands to pull her legs toward herself.

The man will be on his knees and lean over her so she can rest her ankles on his shoulders, which will allow for extra deep penetration.

4. The Jockey

A variation of doggy, in this position, the woman lies on her stomach with her bottom raised. The man then straddles her and enters her from behind.

As the man can penetrate with a lot of force, this position is great for those who climax from passionate or rough sex.","vulgar"

When you write “Is sex …?” into Google, the first thing to pop up is, “is sex addiction real?”

To answer this, the Daily Star Online spoke to Rebecca Dakin, The Great British Sexpert who revealed not only is is real, but it can consume your entire life.

“Yes, it is a very real thing,” Rebecca said. “It is much more common now because of the Internet and the access to porn which is so readily available.”

“It involves lack of control along with sexual urges and behaviours, however it isn’t recognised medically as there is a debate of whether it’s just an excuse for infidelity.”

Addiction to sex can be likened to any other addiction – whether it be food, alcohol, caffeine – and can also be referred to as hyper sexual behaviour or nymphomania.

“In extreme cases, people want to have sex multiple times a day and are constantly thinking about it,” Rebecca explained.

“They could just be walking down the street and get a sudden urge and then will have to find the nearest bathroom just so they can relieve themselves. It can take over your life.”

Rebecca explained it is difficult to know the exact number of people who suffer from the addiction as women don’t generally want to admit to it.

“There is still a stigma around women who enjoy sex as they are seen as ‘promiscuous’ or it’s shameful, and they are judged. So there are many women with sex addictions who go undiagnosed,"" she said.

“Sex addiction can affect men and women at many different stages in their lives. There is a rise in younger, school-aged children because they have access to the internet at a younger age.”

If you feel like you have a sex addiction, Rebecca advised to do some research online first and see if you have any of the symptoms. With this knowledge, you can then seek help.

Rebecca, who is a trained therapist, uses hypnotherapy on her clients to help them suppress their urges. Yet she said other options include psychotherapy, behavioural therapy, sex addiction groups and in extreme cases, medication.

However, if you think your partner is the one who suffers from addiction, communication is key.

“You have to be able to talk openly with your partner and broach the topic sensitively,” she said.

“Explore the options before you bring it up. In my experience you can’t just turn around to someone with an addiction and say you’re an addict. They have to figure it out for themselves. Be sensitive to how they may be feeling about it.”

Rebecca said one of the things that can happen when you are in a relationship with some who is a sex addict is the partner can feel they are seen as just sex rather than a person, and a “lot of resentment building up there”.

To avoid this, talk to your partner about it and figure out a way you can work through it together.

But would you munch on a box of cannabis chocolates to amp up your sex drive?

High-end chocolatier 1906 has launched a fancy cannabis-infused chocolate bar dubbed “High Love”.

It’s the first cannabis chocolate aphrodisiac on the market and is ""studded with a lustful blend of all-natural, romantic stimulants"".

The sweet treat contains a blend of exotic ingredients including muira puama (known as the Viagra of the Amazon), yohimbe (an aphrodisiac from West Africa, and damiana (a libido-boosting shrub used by ancient Aztecs).

Each dark milk chocolate bite contains five milligrams of THC and five milligrams of CBD – which they say is similar to the buzz you’d experience from a glass of wine.

High Love should kick in after 15 to 20 minutes thanks to its “rapid delivery” making it faster than other edibles.

One woman from the US, where cannabis is legalised for medicinal use, revealed she and her husband sampled some the sex-boosting chocolate squares – and the sweets really did rev up her desire.

Writing for Cosmopolitan, Krista McHarden said: “While he claimed to not feel high or horny, he is usually in the mood for sex, and so we did it.

“And it was especially delicious for me. Usually I'm kinda lazy and we opt for missionary mainly because being on top is some work.

“But because of the sexual chocolate, I was game. I was all over the place — up, down, and all around.

“Normally our sex life is good — despite all the s*** I talk on our sex life, we have fun — but this was next-level howling at the moon-type magic.”

Currently the pills are only available from medical dispensaries in Colorado, US – providing you have a medical marijuana card – but they should be available in California too by 2018.

At the moment in the UK the government hasn’t recognised the medicinal value of weed – even heroin is ranked as having more therapeutic benefits – so it’s unlikely that Brits will be popping sweets to improve their sex drives any time soon.

Meanwhile High Love isn’t the first unusual marijuana-based product to hit the market.

Last year the world’s first weed-infused vagina pill was released by Foria.

Dubbed Foria Relief, the vaginal suppository is basically medical marijuana for your lady bits and it’s designed to ease period pains and menstrual cramps.

Made from cocoa butter infused with a mix of THC (cannabis’s hallucinogenic element) and CBD (the healing part), the tampon-sized insert aims to “maximise muscle relaxing and pain relieving” without getting you high.","vulgar"

Often, people can be distracted by their lives outside of the bedroom, but even if your partner is in the moment, they may actually be fantasising about something, or someone, else.

A study from Boise State University found that over half of straight women are attracted to other women.

Year on year when Pornhub release their telling statistics, the term “lesbian” is always high up on the list if not the top of the list for the most-searched for terms by women.

And a study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found women physically responded to videos of both naked men and women.

So, why do straight women fantasise about other women during sex?

""Our fantasies don't overlap 100% with our actual desires,"" sex therapist Vanessa Marin told Glamour magazine.

""Most people have entertained fantasies about things that they don't actually want to do in real life. Sometimes fantasising about something we know we wouldn't do in real life is exactly what makes the fantasy so hot.""

So no, just because your girlfriend watches and enjoys lesbian porn this doesn’t mean she will be looking to have a threesome any time soon.

However, according to an Adam and Eve survey, a third of women have kissed another woman.

“Fantasising about a very sensual or sexual woman can also be a way for us to access our sexuality in a way that we don't feel confident enough doing on our own,” Vanessa continued.

She added that men also lie somewhere on the spectrum between gay and straight but men are less likely to admit it as it’s “much more socially permissible for women to acknowledge same-sex curiosities.”","vulgar"

Surprisingly 63% of men confessed that smelling sweetly can be a turn-off, according to the results of a new study.

The survey, conducted by extra-marital dating site Victoria Milan, sniffed around the private lives of 5,807 cheating adults from 10 countries to find out how big a role smell plays in sexual attraction.

In fact guys admitted they’d prefer their female lovers to be themselves and let their natural scent do the talking.

But if you are going to spray some perfume, men are also quite particular about which scents they find sexy.

When it comes to ladies’ perfumes, floral scents are the hottest followed closely by fruity (32%).

Sporty (22%) claimed nearly one-fifth of the votes and spicy fragrances will entrance just 15% of gents.

Sigurd Vedal, founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, revealed that a chance in scent could hint that your partner is being adulterous.

He said: “There’s no doubt that perfume is what initially attracts lovers to each other and now we’ve discovered that between the sheets, lovers want each other laid bare – completely natural.

“We don’t want to give away any secrets, but if your husband or wife either stops wearing perfume, or changes their ‘signature scent’ that’s a good indication someone’s told them they smell better without it.

""And that probably happened while they were having wild, passionate sex.”

Meanwhile smelling fresh isn’t just important to men because most ladies agree bad body odour is a huge deal-breaker – and it will ruin your chances of getting lucky.

A massive 78% of women would go home alone rather than sleep with a man who smells bad.

Men on the other hand are more likely to take what they can get: five in every 10 say they’ll put up with any stench once they have a lady in the bedroom.

Reeking badly was also proven to be a relationship deal-breaker because half of the ladies admitted to ending it purely because the smell of her partner didn’t please her.","vulgar"

Scientists have discovered that couples experience an ""afterglow"" of sexual satisfaction 48 hours later.

The study also shed new light on how getting down and dirty helps to bond lovers together even more than was previously believed.

It doesn’t matter how long the couple has been together, because getting jiggy can strengthen ties no matter what.

Psychologist Dr Andrea Meltzer, of Florida State University, said: ""Our research shows sexual satisfaction remains elevated 48 hours after sex.

""And people with a stronger sexual afterglow - that is, people who report a higher level of sexual satisfaction 48 hours after sex – report higher levels of relationship satisfaction several months later.""

The study of married couples indicates that lovers experience a long-lasting sexual “afterglow” which is linked with relationship quality.

Researchers examined data from two independent studies over long periods of time – one with 96 newlyweds and the other with 118.

Overall participants' marital satisfaction declined between the beginning of the study and a follow-up session four to six months later.

But those who reported relatively high levels of sexual afterglow seemed to fare better than their peers.

They reported higher initial marital satisfaction and less steep declines across the first few months of marriage.

The findings, published in Psychological Science, suggest sex is linked with relationship quality over time through the lingering effects of sexual satisfaction.

Dr Meltzer said: ""This research is important because it joins other research suggesting that sex functions to keep couples pair bonded.""

Scientists had theorised sex plays a crucial role in pair bonding but most adults report having sex with their partners every few days not every day.

The researchers thought sex might provide a short-term boost to sexual satisfaction – sustaining the pair bond in between sexual experiences and enhancing partners' relationship satisfaction over the long term.

Dr Meltzer added: ""We explored how long sexual satisfaction would remain elevated following sex and predicted stronger sexual afterglow would characterise more satisfying partnerships.

""We pooled the data from two independent, longitudinal studies of newlywed couples to examine these issues.

""Results demonstrated sexual satisfaction remained elevated approximately 48 hours after sex – and spouses experiencing a stronger afterglow reported higher levels of marital satisfaction both at the start and over time.

""We interpret these findings as evidence sexual afterglow is a proximal cognitive mechanism through which sex promotes pair bonding.""

Previous research has found adults who make love first thing in the morning boost their immune system.

The chemicals released during morning intercourse can improve health and mood for the whole day.

Not only does it make them less likely to catch a cold or flu, it can also improve the quality of their hair, skin, and nails.

Other research has found having sex three times a week could halve the risk of heart attack or stroke.

Meanwhile another study found having sex every day improves sperm quality and could boost the chances of getting pregnant.

In tests of men with fertility problems, daily ejaculation for a week cut the amount of DNA damage seen in sperm samples.

Men who keep up a regular sex life in their 50s have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/598271/What-is-jelqing-how-to-jelq-is-jelqing-safe-how-to-make-penis-bigger","What is jelqing? Men are using this dangerous technique to lengthen their penises","A couple of months ago, a man named Roberto Esquivel Cabrera made headlines after it was revealed he had the world’s longest penis.

The Mexican native’s penis is 18.9 inches long, and he has refused to have penile reduction surgery.

Roberto’s penis is so big in fact, he cannot have sex and the reason for the length is not down to genetics, but because of a technique called “jelqing”.

This is where a man squeezes and stretches his penis to make it longer.

Roberto would wrap bands around his penis with weights as a teenager in order to stretch it.

The more popular techniques of jelqing however, are making an “O” with your thumb and index finger to stretch the shaft – similar to masturbation.

The second technique is called the “pincher” which involves placing your thumb on the bottom of the shaft while the index finger goes on top and you move your fingers in a pinching motion.

""Essentially what these men are doing is a stretching and tugging exercise to basically put on some length, and they claim some girth as well,"" said Seth D. Cohen, urologist and Director of Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction at NYU Langone Medical Center.

This phenomenon is mainly seen in young men and there are now Reddit threads and Youtube channels solely dedicated to it.

While the technique sounds similar to masturbation, according to the Reddit threads, men should jelq for 20 minutes “every other day” and they are told not to try it while their penis is erect.

""When it comes to things like that, you have to think who are they lengthening it for,"" The Great British Sexpert, Rebecca Dakin told the Daily Star Online.

""Women have a G-spot which is a couple of inches inside so for a man to hit it, their penis doesn't need to be that long – they're damaging themselves which is really not necessary.

""Men are much more concerned about the size of their penis than women are and instead of trying to lengthen it, they should learn to use what they've got.""

""I would never tell a patient 'yes' or 'no,'"" Seth said. ""All I would tell them is you’re more likely to do harm than achieve any benefits of 'stretching' your penis.""

Seth added that the process is dangerous as you are constantly tugging at your penis which will damage the nerves, arteries and veins.

This can actually lead to decreased sensation of the penis and essentially erectile dysfucntion.

While Seth said many men jelq because they feel insecure about their penis size, numerous studies have shown there are many things women care more about than the size of a man’s penis.","vulgar"

For a woman to have stronger orgasms, she needs to have stronger pelvic floor muscles. And the only way to get strong pelvic floor muscles? To do specific exercises targeting this area.

As women get older, pelvic floor muscles become even more important as they weaken with age which can lead to urinary incontinence and decreased sensitivity during sex.

Meet Elvie. Elvie is a pelvic floor exercise tracker, shaped like a green bean with a tail.

The way Elvie works is, first you connect the device wirelessly to your phone (and to the app that comes with it) and insert it inside the vagina, leaving the tail bit on the outside.

The app includes six “unique exercises” – or games – to “give your pelvic floor a full workout”.

These games involve squeezing your vagina muscles to beat your high scores.

You can then unlock new levels and games as you go – and it only takes five minutes per day a few times a week.

YouTube channel Secureteam10 believes the alien ship was vaporised by a giant fireball seen hurtling through space.

“Maybe we can discover who is behind it.

With the Premier League having recently secured a landmark ruling aimed at stopping illegal streams of its matches, it appears that the sanctions are now coming into action.

The new ruling gives the league the ability to block entire servers that are linked with rights-infringing streams of its matches.

Previously, rights holders were only permitted to close down individual streams.

The issue with this set-up was that closed streams could easily, and quickly, be switched to a new server and instantly started back up.

Under the new rules, the Premier League will be able to shut entire servers.

This will make it much harder for those illegally presenting the content to re-establish dodgy streams.

The ruling has been introduced as so-called fully loaded Kodi boxes have grown in popularity.

Although Kodi is a perfectly legal service letting you access all of your legitimate streams in a single location, plug-ins can be added.

A number of these have been developed to offer payment free, and completely illegal access to live sports, TV box sets and major Hollywood movies.

The Premier League sort the new rules to help protect the likes of Sky Sports and BT Sport who pay huge sums for exclusive access to its football matches.

“The Premier League is currently engaged in its largest ever anti-piracy campaign to protect its copyright,” a spokesman for the league said speaking with the Guardian.

They added: “Like other sports and creative industries our model is predicated on the ability to market an sell rights and protect our intellectual property.

“It is because of this that clubs can invest in and develop talented players, build world-class stadium, support the English football pyramid and schools and communities across the country - all things that fans enjoy and wider society benefits from.”

The move is the latest in a high-profile push to crack down on copyright infringements, with arrests having already been made.

One man was recently hit with a huge £250,000 fine for selling “fully loaded” boxes.

Taking out advertisements in national magazines falsely claiming the boxes were ‘100% legal’, the man attempted to see the dodgy devices to bars and clubs.

Authorities have been keen to make consumers aware of the legality of their actions.

“The law as we see it, as we are advised by our legal people, is that if you are a public house, or club, or business of that nature, who is illegally accessing this particular content - if you’re streaming it, you are committing an offence,” Howard Turton of the National Trading Standards North East Regional Investigations Team said recently.

He added: “If you are Joe public, who has bought one of these boxes, technically you might be committing an offence - but it’s very difficult for enforcement bodies to tackle a person in their own home doing this type of thing.”","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/601633/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-face-recognition-privacy-security-warning","Samsung Galaxy S8 Security Warning - Major S8 feature could put your privacy at risk","The Samsung Galaxy S8 has yet to hit retailers’ shelves and yet it’s already at the centre of a security scandal.

The phone, which was formally unveiled earlier this week, is Samsung’s first flagship release since last year’s ill-fated Galaxy Note 7.

Instead of crawling out from the Note’s battery fire caused shadow, however, it appears that the S8 could be troubled by it’s own issues.

Rather than battery combustion concerns, it’s the S8’s facial recognition feature that’s cause for concern this time around.

The S8’s face recognition feature, which means the phone is capable of learning your face and unlocking automatically when you, and only you pick up the phone, was one of the phone’s big talking points during its grand unveiling.

It might not be as secure as we were all led to believe, however.

A video has already emerged of the face recognition feature being fooled by a photograph of a user.

This means that if your phone was stolen, all the thief would need is your image to be able to gain access to all of your private emails, images and contacts.

The compromising video was captured by iDeviceHelp and shows the S8 being unlocked by being pointed to a fullscreen selfie of a user displayed on another phone.

Although taking a few attempts to fool the phone, the S8 was eventually duped by the selfie, unlocking its secrets for anyone with nefarious intentions to behold.

According to an unnamed industry source speaking with The Korea Herald, the S8’s facial tracking tech is not secure enough to be used to protect your phone.

“For now, the facial recognition technology is only intended for fun. It should not be considered as a foolproof security measure,” the report states.

While the S8’s facial recognition might not be particularly secure, it’s not the phone’s only biometric security measure.

The S8 also features an integrated iris scanner as well as the traditional fingerprint sensor.

Unlike past years, the S8’s fingerprint scanner has been moved to the rear of the device.

That’s because the S8’s physical home button has been ditched in order to allow the phone’s screen to be stretched out across more of the handset’s by.

Potential security shortcomings aside, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is shaping up as the phone of 2017.

Its stunning, near edge-to-edge screen and sleek, metal-edged, glass-backed design is backed up by a flurry of high-end features.

This includes a powerful new oct-core processor and 4GB of RAM as well as a sizeable 3,000mAh battery and Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat OS skinned with a stylish new Samsung UX interface.

On a hardware front, the phone’s 5.8-inch screen packs a stunning 2960 x 1440 pixel QHD+ resolution and lines up alongside a 12-megapixel rear-mounted camera and an 8-megapixel selfie snapper.

Despite having been unveiled, the Galaxy S8 won’t hit retailers’ shelves until April 28.

Those looking to snap up the phone will have to fork out £689 to secure the phone that boasts 64GB of internal storage.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/601377/Pirate-Bay-Pornhub-torrent-free-online-movies","The Pirate Bay faces serious torrent challenge from this surprising XXX rival","Torrent websites such as The Pirate Bay and KickAss Torrents are facing renewed competition from an unlikely source.

New reports have claimed that cybercriminals are using the world’s most popular XXX-rated site Pornhub to host illegal copies of major movies.

These aren’t the sort of adult-only spoofs you’d expect to find on the porn site either, but dodgy copies of legitimate Hollywood blockbusters.

According to the reports, Pornhub users have shared a range of copyright-protected movies amidst the usual catalogue of filth.

The new piracy trend is being driven by a small community of cybercriminals.

Some have even created a specialist forum on popular social news site Reddit to promote and encourage the process.

One to the users on the r/FullMoviesOnPornhub thread explained why the pornographic site is being specifically targeted.

They suggested that the site, which has more than 70 million unique users per day, has a less strict Content ID copyright protection system than more general services such as Youtube.

One user, who identifies via the username FreeEntertainment, stated: “My original plans to upload movies I’ve downloaded to YouTube as an unlisted video so I could just share the links between friends and family.

“It didn’t work so I decided to upload a movie here just to see what would happen.”

Movies uploaded include major hits such as Star Wars Rouge One, Avengers Age of Ultron, and Step Brothers.

Further recently released films including Dr Strange, Bad Santa 2, and Moana have also been illegally uploaded to Pornhub.

The 2015 released Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is one of the most viewed illegal movie uploads on currently on the site having already racked up more than 60,000 views.

Despite sizeable viewer figures, not everyone has been impressed by the lack of smut and rise of Hollywood hits, with one commenter asking: “Why is this on here?”

It’s not just Pornhub visitors that are unimpressed by the piracy additions, those behind the website aren’t too happy either.

“Here at Pornhub we strongly condemn uploading non authorised content to our platform,” the website’s VP Corey Price told the Daily Star.

“In instances that someone does upload non authorised content, we strongly encourage our users to flag such videos with us.

“Out Terms of Service only allows for users to upload content that they themselves own.

“Pornhub abides by DMCA law with regards to takedown requests and we remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it - as has been the case with any and all full, theatrically released movies.”

The torrent site avoiding move comes as regulatory bodies have increased their crack down on those who download illegally copyrighted content as part of the new Get It Right campaign.

As part of the initiative, UK internet service providers have started sending out warning emails to those found to have downloaded illegal content.

Those hit with the warnings have 20 days to stop downloading copyrighted material before more action is taken.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/601664/BBC-licence-fee-price-increase-iPlayer-television-licence-cost","BBC iPlayer Price Hike - Watching the Beeb’s online content gets more expensive TODAY","Fans of BBC iPlayer are being forced to pay more in order to watch their favourite online content.

For the first time in over six years, the UK’s television licence fee is increasing in price.

Starting today, April 1, everyone required to pay the annual, BBC-funding fee will see their yearly bill increased to £147.

With the license fee having previously been capped at £145.50, the price hike marks an annual rise of £1.50.

While this might not sound like the biggest price rise, multiplied across the millions of license fee payers, and it marks a major increase in funding for the BBC.

For the first time ever, the price rise doesn’t just effect those who watch live TV content either.

Those who enjoy online BBC iPlayer content at any time are now forced to fork out for the yearly license, whether they own a television or not.

Whether you watch BBC content live or on-demand, on your TV, laptop, smartphone or tablet, the single, newly increased fee is applicable to all.

The Government is responsible for setting the level of the licence fee, and last year announced that it would rise in line with inflation for five years from 1 April 2017.

Those buying or renewing a licence after 1 April will pay the new fee.

Current licence fee holders will not be required to pay the inflated price until their licence is next due for renewal.

If you currently pay for your TV licence on an instalment scheme, assuming it started before April 1, your monthly or quarterly direct debits will continue to be taken to the annual value of £145.50.

When your license is up for renewal, you will be required to pay the increased fee.

The new licence fee costs come into effect as it’s announced that iPlayer viewers will soon need to register for personal accounts in order to watch the online hosted content.

New rules revealed will require users to sign up for a BBC ID account to watch their favourite shows on mobile devices or computers, as well as listen to radio programming and access several BBC mobile apps.

Currently, no registration or set-up is needed to watch BBC programming, whether live or on catch-up, across the iPlayer services - but viewers do need to hold a valid UK TV licence.

The move comes as part of the corporation's move to make a ""more personal"" BBC.

Tony Hall, BBC director general, said: ""By learning about what you want and like we can take you to more of the great programmes you love, stories you might be interested in and content you might otherwise never have discovered.

""This is a real transformation - reinventing public service broadcasting for the digital age.”

""Millions of people are already benefitting from this more personalised BBC, and by rolling it out for everyone no one will be left behind.”","geeky"

As well as the usual mix of pleasure and shame, there’s also the nagging fear of what if hackers exposed what I was doing.

With the number of hacks to major adult websites recently, it’s a justified fear.

Now however, it just became safer than ever to watch porn online, removing the fear and upping the enjoyment levels.

That’s because the world’s most popular adult website Pornhub has moved to a new safety protocol.

Along with sister site YouPorn, Pornhub has confirmed with will switch to the more safe and secure HTTPS protocol in the coming days.

While Pornhub has already made the move, on April 4 YouPorn will make the jump, making it harder for hackers to compromise users’ accounts when visiting the potentially embarrassing services.

Until now, just three of the world’s 11 most visited adult websites have shifted to the secure protocol, with Pornhub’s announcement shifting that figure towards the half way mark.

If you're about to indulge in some private internet alone time then, you should always check the site is HTTPS secured first.

The HTTPS protocol encrypts all communications and connections between users and websites, ensuring all privacy and integrity of exchanged data is maintained even if intercepted.

The adult website has described the move as one of the most proactive measures it has taken yet to ensure users’ privacy.

“Here at Pornhub, with more than 70 million daily visitors, we wanted to continue our concerted effort to maximise the privacy of our users, ensuring that what they do on our platform remains strictly confidential,” said Corey Price, Porbhub’s Vice President.

“With the switch to HRRPS we are able to protect their identity as well as safeguard them against exposure to malware by third parties.

“With this internet communication protocol we can ensure not only the security of our platform, but also that of our users. At the end of the day, we want every single one of them to feel safe and secure on our platform while enjoying our library of over 5 million videos.”

Comfortably one of the world’s 100 most visited websites, Pornhub has the largest membership base of any adult website.

The site records staggering viewership numbers with more than 1 billion video views per month.

Pornhub’s move comes as it has emerged the site is being used by torrent enthusiasts to share illegal copyrighted content.

The site has been targeted as it features less rigid copyright protection upload tests than general purpose video sharing sites such as YouTube.","geeky"

The new feature has been spotted by thousands of the social network’s users but is still not available to everyone.

The update introduces a secret second News Feed that is completely separate from your traditional timeline.

Users who’ve been granted early access have seen a small spaceship icon appear on their Facebook app.

The spaceship icon has popped up beneath the search bar, lining up alongside the traditional notifications tab.

Clicking it takes users away from their traditional timeline of friends’ messages and image uploads, to a new Explore feed.

The Explore section, as its name suggests, offers a feed of content from sources you don’t actively follow.

Instead, Facebook generates the list of content based on things it believes you’ll be interested in.

Using extensive algorithms, it does this by looking at your personal preferences and content that both you and your friends have previously deemed worthy of a thumbs up ‘Like’.

The more you use and engage with the Explore feed, the more the service will refine the sort of content you’re presented with, learning your likes and dislikes.

Facebook hopes the move will open users to new content and prevent them being endlessly exposed to the same sources.

So far, the icon has only been seen on select iOS devices.

Facebook has yet to confirm when the new Explore feature will be rolled out to the masses.

The new Facebook feature has appeared just days after a clever new Facebook hack emerged.

The sneaky feature lets users read direct Facebook messages without the sender ever knowing.

By dodging those pesky read receipts, users can avoid awkward conversations by claiming they’ve not see the message.

There’s now a great way to boost your phone’s inbuilt storage, however.

You don’t even need to delete any of the content currently cluttering up your handset.

Instead, all you have to do is download and install Apple’s latest free software patch, iOS 10.3.

The new software update, which brings a number of impressive new features, also hosts the ability to clear up wasted on-device storage.

Devices updated to iOS 10.3 will free up precious storage space automatically with the software moving supported hardware to a new Apple File System (APFS).

Originally announced at last year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, the APFS storage system replaces the company’s 31-year-old Hierarchical File System (HFS).

Although having serviced the company well over the past three decades, the HFS system was original designed for Apple Mac computers with floppy or spinning hard drives.

As a result, although perfectly functional, it wasn’t the most efficient when it came to mobile devices with solid state storage.

The new APFS system, however, has been designed from the ground-up to support flash and solid state storage.

According to tech blog The Verge, a byproduct of the move is more user available storage.

It’s suggested that this is due to the way that the APFS system calculates available data on your compatible iOS device.

The iOS 10.3 update is available now as a free download for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users.

To add the new iOS 10.3 operating system to your phone, you’ll need to head to Settings > General > Software Update and select the download option.

The increased storage availability is just one of a number of new features headed to iPhones running the new iOS 10.3 software.

Elsewhere, the patch introduces a new Find my AirPods feature that lets you locate your wireless ear buds and even make each bud play audio in order to make them easy to locate.

Users upgrading to the new software have now also been handed the ability to label reviews in the App Store as helpful and given more freedom over the devices they watch their iTunes-based rentals on.

The iOS 10.3 update has dropped just weeks before Apple is expected to unveil its next-generation iOS 11 software.

The heavily refreshed software is expected to be the star of the show at June’s WWDC 2017 gathering in California.","geeky"

Although rising in popularity due to their convenience and ease of use, mobile-based payment services such as Apple Pay and Android Pay could land you in serious hot water at the drive thru.

That’s because even stationary at a drive thru payment window, this classes as a law-breaking use of your phone while driving.

Although the standard fine for using your phone while behind the wheel is £200 and six penalty points, this can be increased to £1,000 if your case goes to court.

Changes to the law planned on cracking down on smartphone use by drivers means this fine could soon because available as an instant punishment.

Under the new laws, simply touching your phone while piloting a car could land you a £1,000 fine and six license-tarnishing penalty points.

According to reports from Essex Live, this punishment could be handed out to anyone caught using a mobile device to pay for their fast food drive thru fix.

The peculiar punishment was revealed after a question posed on Twitter.

Taking to the social network, McDonalds fan Jay Chase asked Greater Manchester Police (GMP ) Traffic if using Apple Pay to pay at a drive-thru was legal or not.

“I need a debate settling, can I use Apple Pay in @McDonalds drive through without losing my license?” he wrote.

The reply was not what he, or millions of other tech loving fast food fans, was hoping for.

“If your engine is off and your handbrake applied and you’re parked yes. If your engine is on NO,” GMP Traffic replied.

For some, being caught using Apple Pay at a drive through could see them stripped of their licence completely.

Those in their first two years since of driving will be banned from the road if they receive six penalty points.

Usually, drivers can receive up to 12 penalty points before losing their license.

Responding to the news a McDonalds spokesperson said their drive-thrus are designed in such a way as to reduce the risk of dangerous driving.

“When customers enter our drive thrus, a number of restrictions are in place with the aim of preventing irresponsible and dangerous driving,” they said.

“Customers using our drive thru lanes will be moving slowly in a dedicated vehicle lane.

“Additional restrictions can include a speed limit of 5mph, speed bumps, large vehicles being unable to enter and customers having to be stationary when offering their chosen method of payment.”

They added: “We would hope that all of our restrictions would be taken into account and common sense used when the police are applying the rules of this law.”","geeky"

You’re not alone, and fortunately, now your dream has become a reality.

There’s now a way to read your direct Facebook messages without the sender ever finding out by blocking those pesky read receipts.

Read receipts are the little symbols that sit alongside messages to show when they’ve been delivered and read.

While many appreciate their presence, knowing an important message has been received, others are annoyed at the way they force you into acknowledging you’ve seen a messaging, bringing an abrupt end to you favoured “nah, didn’t see it, mate” excuses.

Unlike rival platforms including iMessage and WhatsApp, Facebook doesn’t provide an official solution for blocking these read receipts within Messenger.

There is now a work-around solution, however.

To dodge being revealed by the annoying alerts, you’ll need to make sure you’re using Facebook through the Google Chrome browser.

You’ll also want to make sure you’ve downloaded the simple Chrome add-on, Unseen.

As it’s name suggests, the Unseen plug-in lets you hide your presence while reading Facebook messages while online.

The add-on is capable blocking both the “seen” and “typing” notifications that appear within Facebook Messenger.

It’s not capable of blocking everything, however.

It will also be stretched close to both the top and bottom edges of the phone.

As previously hinted by industry tipsters, it also shows how the phone could adopt a new, vertically aligned dual-lens camera.

Rather than an official image of the actual device, the teased snap is a concept render based on the latest insight.

It’s claimed the image has been based on “exclusive information from a source with intimate knowledge of Apple’s manufacturing facility.”

But just 10 weeks later she began bleeding and faced the anguish of miscarrying her child.

Doctors reassured Amanda that there was nothing medically wrong with her and there was no reason why she wouldn’t become a mum in the future.

But after falling pregnant for a second time, she carried the baby for 10 weeks before suffering another miscarriage.

It wasn’t long before Amanda fell pregnant for a third time and this time she “got lucky” and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

Writing for the Mirror, Amanda said: “He felt like my reward for the loss I’d experienced, and with my newborn child in my arms, my life felt complete and all memories of my miscarriages were swept from my mind.”

Amanda’s relationship with her baby’s dad broke down and she went on to meet her current husband Simeon, who also had a child from a previous marriage.

The pair wanted to try for a baby together and Amanda quickly fell pregnant again.

Nine weeks into the pregnancy, Amanda “woke in the middle of the night with a familiar cramp” in her stomach, meaning her worst fears had been realised again.

But the couple were determined to try again. Tragically, the mum-of-one endured three further miscarriages – one at six weeks and two at 12 weeks.

The last time Amanda fell pregnant she was hit with severe morning sickness but doctors assured her it was a sign of a strong pregnancy.

Her soldier husband Simeon had been posted to Iraq, leaving Amanda racked with fear for his life.

Amanda’s pregnancy was going well until she went for her 23-week scan and was hit with an earth-shattering blow – her baby had died one week earlier.

Knowing she was due for her check-up, Simeon called Amanda from Iraq and she burst into tears.

But in the midst of the couple’s grief, the phone line cut out.

Amanda wrote: “Without warning, the phone went dead.

“My heart leapt – was it due to loss of signal, which sometimes occurred in his location, or had something happened to him?

""There was no way for me to get in contact… I felt alone and frightened.”

The next day she heard a knock at the door and immediately feared it was “the knock all army families dread”.

But standing there in the doorway was Simeon, still in his desert combats and with sand in his hair, who said: “I told you I’d always come to you if you needed me.”

The soldier explained the abrupt ending to their phone call, saying he was forced to hang up as he had to run for a plane which was leaving minutes later.

Now Amanda and Simeon have given up hope of having another baby but believe the gut-wrenching experiences they have gone through together has made their realtionship stronger as a result.

She said: “Simeon is still a serving soldier and, of course, I still worry about him when he is away.

“The loneliness doesn’t fade, but the bond we have, in part because of what we have been through, is strong.

“I sometimes think of the ages the babies would be now and what they’d be doing. These thoughts make me sad, but also bring me comfort.

“I wish there wasn’t such stigma attached to miscarriage – and I wish I understood why it ‘just happens’.”

But little does he know Ben has swapped the keycards so Elliot is actually in stunner Joanna May Parker’s room.

And to add to the surprise, she’s parading around in the raunchy get-up.

At first she stays hidden and causes all sorts of mischief by running a bath, stealing food and even leaving a sex toy under the pillow in the bedroom.

Her covert moves are being filmed by prankster Ben, who struggles to contain his laughter as she wiggles her bum to the camera while nicking some more hotel food.

Eventually he convinces her to confront Elliot and he gets the shock of his life when he sees the bombshell in her saucy get-up in what he thinks is his hotel room.

But his reaction is not what you expect as he picks up a chair and asks her to get out the room before running into a window when she smashes a glass and comes at him.

Thankfully it was all part of the prank, which has been viewed more than one million times since it was uploaded.","boorish"

In the footage the women dance in front of three lads outside a building.

Soon it becomes clear the ladies are in the mood for some fun as they start to undress each other.

They continue to gyrate as they go down to their underwear, and one lucky guy is filming the whole striptease on his phone.

Then his moment comes as one of the girls, wearing sexy black lingerie, asks for him to undo her bra.

But disaster strikes for the eager man as, with his phone in one hand recording the sexy show, he completely fails to undo the pesky item of clothing.

After a few seconds bumbling and fumbling, the guy can’t get it off and the bombshell loses patience.

She walks away and within seconds both of the babes are putting their clothes back on with the moment gone, despite the last desperate attempts by the guy to keep the stripping going.

The video, from CCTV camera in Russia, was uploaded this week and viewers couldn’t believe the guy’s ineptitude.

“Holy hell...that was pathetic,” wrote one.

The brunette stunner – who owns YouTube Channel Banshee Moon – sent viewers wild by stripping her top off to try on a tight T-shirt with no bra and paraded around outside wearing only a painted-on bikini.

And now she's sent the internet bonkers by offering to go completely naked.

But only if she's given $2million (£1.6m).

In the above video, Jennifer strolls around her garden with her husband and discusses the subject of baring all with her husband.

She says: ""I have a really good friend who interviewed me and said that a lot people are asking me to take my clothes off and what would it take?

""I told her 'it's not really my thing' but she pressed me for a number.""

The gorgeous brunette then said she would go ahead with her promise if the full $2million sum was raised.

And so far Jennifer's fan have been completely divided over the idea.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/601541/prince-musician-home-paisley-park-palace-america-died","EXCLUSIVE: Inside Prince’s incredible Paisley Park Palace where purple reigned","With a nightclub, basketball court, concert hall, a pet dove in mourning and a private vegan chef – Paisley Park is more than just your usual celebrity home.

For Prince it was his whole life wrapped up into one eccentric space where he could work and play.

For decades people speculated about life behind the famous doors of his bizarre space-age looking home.

April 21 marks one year since the iconic pop star died suddenly here aged just 57 following an accidental prescription drug overdose.

Now, a year on, it’s become a mecca for fans flocking to see inside his crazy world.

With tickets released at the end of 2016 selling out in super-fast time, I was one of the first UK journalists to step through the famous Paisley Park doors and get a glimpse of the legend’s home.

The $10million pad was built by the megastar in 1987. Named after Prince’s 1985 song Paisley Park, it was way more than the place where he lived and recorded his music – it was ground zero for the star and many of his interactions with fans.

The walls and ceiling are covered with a mural of blue skies and clouds which lead you through to the main atrium, a double-height room with a decadent glass ceiling which floods the room with light. “He wanted to remind himself that there was no ceiling to his creativity,” I’m told.

It’s fitting here then, that placed up high but still in full view is the urn that holds the megastar’s ashes. It’s an emotional first stop for fans. Of the few who have managed to get tickets since the house opened for a limited time, most have broken down into floods of tears here.

Shortly after his death, it was announced it would be converted into a permanent memorial, much like Elvis Presley’s Graceland.

On entering the building I’m greeted with the motto “In this trusted place, you can erase your weary face” on the wall. The main hallway is covered in his gold and platinum discs.

“Prince dreamed of a space where he could have everything under one roof and at the time of his death this was his full-time home,” explains my guide, who worked for Prince.

Glass doors lead to a little kitchen set up like an all-American diner with black and white leather booths. On the right there’s a black leather sofa and a flatscreen TV. This was Prince’s favourite spot to watch sports, where he would often cheer on his local NBA team, the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Rooms leading off the atrium have been transformed with items of personal clothing and rare, unseen memorabilia to commemorate some of his most famous works. There’s a Dirty Mind Room, which includes his 1977 notebook of song lyrics, his cassette Walkman and his customised guitars. The Controversy Room follows and a decadent Diamonds and Pearls room.

Here I see up close his famous pearl jacket, pearl vest, the yellow and purple jacket with padded shoulders he wore on stage – and it’s immediately clear of his petite 5ft 2in size.

Next we head into Prince’s office. There’s a velvet purple chair and the shelves are full of books about Egypt and the Pharaohs, as well as a Bible.

There’s pictures of his family and, at the side, a cat-carry box for one of his pets, aptly named Paisley. There’s also a purple chaise lounge, proving it really was his favourite colour.

Then we go into the studio editing bay. “He recorded every professional aspect of his life,” I’m told, before being shown behind-the-scenes footage of his 2004 Musicology tour. We watch acoustic footage of Prince at Madison Square Garden and from Woodstock.

Back out in the atrium we look up to the second-floor apartment where Prince slept.

It’s not open to the public but what we can see clearly is Prince’s pet dove Divinity looking lonely as she sits in a white cage. At 20-years-old, she’s said to have stopped cooing the day her owner died.

Studio A is also a space close to Prince’s heart because it’s where he recorded his most famous works. “This was the centre of his recording universe and it’s why he wanted to live and sleep so close so he could be here whenever the creativity took him,” the guide explains.

Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Celine Dion, Madonna and many more all came here to work with Prince. There’s an impressive grand piano, a drum machine and the OBX synthesiser and keyboard used in When Doves Cry.

At the time of his death Prince was working on a new jazz album and I’m played a sneak preview of the unfinished tracks. His written notes still sit on the music stand, a chilling insight into what could have been. The vocal area of the studio is encased in granite and I’m told it was because he wanted to create a similar affect to singing in the shower – one of his favourite pastimes.

The Purple Rain room was previously a dance rehearsal studio/basketball court and is now a tribute to his most famous work.

It includes the famous motorcycle from the movie, the purple piano as well as his entire wardrobe and personal scripts.

Next I go into his 12,500sq ft concert area, which was “the centre of his TV and film universe”. It’s where Graffiti Bridge was filmed as well as the Sign Of The Times video. Nowadays it holds his piano and all his tour wardrobe items – as well as his Bentley Continental and Plymouth Prowler cars.

Behind is the New Power Generation Nightclub, which hosted some of his wildest parties. Here Prince and his friends could dance, listen to music and he would play intimate gigs.

The club would open sporadically when the star decided to throw a party, but only those closest to him were fortunate to find out when.

The club reflects Prince’s eclectic style and there’s a motif on the walls. A screen plays Finding Nemo, his favourite movie, and his personal chefs would provide nibbles for his guests.

Nowadays they still do and I’m offered a small menu of Prince’s favourite vegan delights.

On the way out there’s also a new addition to Paisley Park – they’ve brought inside the gates outside where fans flocked this time last year.

As I walk past the chain-link fences I read the messages of grief left by his fans in the aftermath of his death.

It’s clear this extraordinary megastar has left behind an equally extraordinary legacy and thanks to Paisley Park, like Graceland, he will be remembered for generations to come.

Just this week, she unwittingly stripped off in front of a hidden camera set up by him.

And last month she forgot she was wearing vibrating knickers to meet the lad’s mum.

But now, Ryan has stepped it up – taking the cheeky underwear prank public.

The video shows the brunette bombshell strolling around a WalMart in a pair of jeans and a tight-fitting top.

Underneath, she’s donning the vibrating knickers which Ryan holds the switch to.

At the age of 19 she became a fighter jet mechanic in Afghanistan.

“I had an M-16 machine gun strapped to me pretty much 24/7,” Hope said.

“This was both the worst and best experience of my life because I did an immense amount of growing and began to see the world differently.”

When her tour came to an end, she decided she needed to change her life.

She became focused on her fitness and would train several times a week.

“A fire started to burn inside me and it couldn't be put out. Lifting weights and eating properly seriously saved my life,” she said.

Now, just four years later, the megababe has 564,000 followers on Instagram who she delights with gorgeous workout and poolside snaps.

She competes as a professional bodybuilder and helps others to conquer their fitness goals as a personal trainer.

And the brunette beauty also happens to be a red-hot model – and her latest Insta videos certainly make the most of her enviable assets.

“You’re totally hot and such an inspiration,” one viewer commented on Hope’s jaw-dropping bikini clip.

Another said: “You have a dream body – ultimate goals.”

Fans have also been going wild recently for fellow Insta-babe Eva Padlock.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/601206/rio-ferdinand-bbc-documentary-football-wife-cancer-death-tough-guy-cry","Rio Ferdinand: The footballing tough guy who isn’t afraid to cry","As a gritty defender for clubs like West Ham, Leeds and Manchester Utd, Rio Ferdinand didn’t give an inch on the pitch, chalking up 81 caps for England too.

But a TV documentary about the loss of his wife Rebecca revealed that behind the crunching tackles the brilliant former centre-back is a caring dad who isn’t afraid to shed a tear.

In the BBC One documentary, Being Mum and Dad, Rio welled up as he revealed the hardship of raising his three kids solo after Rebecca, 34, died from breast cancer in May 2015.

But he has always been more than one of those players who are just obsessed with a pay packet or owning fast cars.

Despite coming from the tough Friary Estate in Peckham, south London – where there is a plaque in his honour – he always showed a softer side.

Born in 1978, Rio grew up in a two-bed flat with his mum Janice, who gave birth to the future star aged just 17, and his younger brother Anton.

His dad Julian, originally from St Lucia in the Caribbean , was a tailor and bouncer, but left the family home when the future footballer was nine.

Given the area he grew up in, Rio could easily have fallen in with the wrong crowd, or worse – he was at school with Stephen Lawrence the black teenager who was infamously stabbed to death in 1993.

But the youngster avoided trouble, once saying of his community: “You became streetwise but you got a sense of real values as well.”

The no-nonsense attitude of his Irish mum, who worked as a childminder, no doubt helped too.

Rio would later reveal: “She cooked and cleaned, and moved heaven and earth to ensure my younger brother Anton and I got to school or youth clubs on time.

“She was also magnificent on our estate. When our neighbour called me the n-word, Mum kicked her door down, dragged her out of her house and made her apologise to me.”

Other boys would have been too scared of taunts from their mates to try something like ballet, but Rio had already shown his prowess in gymnastics and when his teacher suggested that he give the activity a go he jumped at the chance.

He remembers: “I always, as a kid, wanted to do something different.”

In echoes of the hit movie Billy Elliot, the young Ferdinand would visit the Central School of Ballet in Farringdon four times a week for four years, later joking: “I met a lot of girls!”

Rio loved performing. As a pupil at Blackheath Bluecoat School, he starred in the play Bugsy Malone.

And in the classroom he excelled at maths getting a GCSE in the subject along with qualifications in English, PE, drama and science.

But it was football that finally won Rio’s heart. He had honed his skills in the estate’s adventure playground with Anton, who would also be a pro, as would cousins Les and Kane Ferdinand.

He was soon wowing his coaches at youth teams including Eltham Town. One, who saw him play aged 11, branded Rio a “future Pele”.

Before long big-name clubs came calling, sensing his potential.

He trained with the likes of Queens Park Rangers before joining West Ham’s youth side in 1992.

By 1996 he had made his first-team debut and would go on to play for Leeds and chalk up a record transfer fee of nearly £30million when he moved to Manchester United in 2002.

In time he would also play in two World Cups and be made England skipper.

But he never forgot his roots – at just 19 he used his wages to buy his “Super-mum” a £300,000 house near Bromley.

By the age of 21 he had met the other most important woman in his life, fitness trainer Rebecca Ellison.

He called her his soulmate and the pair were married in 2009. In the documentary he paid tribute to his wife, admitting that he had lived a gilded lifestyle as a footballer.

He also confessed that he had found it hard making the transition to looking after Lorenz, now 11, Tate, eight, and Tia, six, on his own.

Rio says: “In football you don’t lift a finger until you go over the white line to play. Everything is done for you.”

The pundit is now trying to move on, dating Towie star Kate Wright, 25, but is still struggling emotionally.

He admits: “You realise playing football was a f***ing walk in the park compared to telling your kids their mum isn’t coming back.”","boorish"

Ex-Manchester United and Everton boss Moyes issued the threats after Sparks interviewed him for the BBC following his side’s 0-0 draw against Burnley last month.

The TV cameras had stopped filming, but Moyes was caught ranting at Sparks by another worker who was recording on their phone.

In the footage he says: “It was getting a wee bit naughty at the end there so just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you’re a woman.”

He added: “Careful the next time you come in.”

Moyes seemed to be upset by Vicki’s final question when she asked whether he was under more pressure because club chairman Ellis Short was watching in the stands.

During the interview he batted off the comment and said: “None at all.”

But his mood turned more sinister as soon as the official grilling was over.

One colleague of Vicki Sparks, who asked not to be named, said last night: “This is disgraceful bullying and sexism ending with a chilling warning.”

Last night a BBC spokesman said: “Mr Moyes has apologised to our reporter and she has accepted his apology.”

A Sunderland spokesman said: “David and the reporter spoke to one another subsequently and the matter was resolved amicably.”

Moyes’ rant was revealed as Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho came under fire for his post-match interview with the BBC’s Conor McNamara.

The Portuguese, whose team had been held to a 0-0 draw by West Bromwich Albion, blasted McNamara’s questions as “stupid”.

Match of the Day pundit Chris Sutton later said Mourinho should focus on “sorting his own team out” rather than rowing with reporters.","dramatic"

At the time, Arsenal had gone behind 2-1 after a goal from Sergio Aguero.

In a separate incident following the match, several onlookers claim Arsenal Fan TV members were set-upon by an angry mob, which had to be pulled apart.

Addressing the outbursts in the ground, under-pressure Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said he did not see any of it.

Addressing the incident after the game, presenter Robbie called the group who confronted them a ""couple of cowards who didn't even watch the match"".

Wrestlemania 33 also sees two of wrestling's real life power couples coming to blows in a match at the mega show.

Daily Star Online can now reveal some of the most stunning WAGs in the world of wrestling ahead of Wrestlemania.

Nikki Bella and John Cena

Two of WWE's biggest stars are an item – and they make no secret about it.

John Cena and Nikki Bella have been going out since November 2012 and put their relationship up on screen in reality show Total Divas and the spin-off Total Bellas.

Nikki is one of the WWE's top women wrestlers – being a two-time Divas' champion – and will tonight join Cena as they face another real-life couple The Miz and Maryse.

There are even rumours Cena and Nikki might be planning to tie the knot, and take some much needed time-off after Wrestlemania 33.

Galina Becker and Roman Reigns

WWE's next big thing Roman Reigns likes to keep his personal life quiet – but occasionally his stunning wife Galina Becker can be seen at his side.

The 29-year-old and ""The Big Dog"" met at the Georgia Institute of Technology while they were students and Reigns was a budding star of American football.

It is rare for WWE stars to have relationships outside the world professional wrestling, but Roman and Galina make it work.

The couple have an 8-year-old daughter called Joelle and got married in December 2014.

Tonight, Reigns fighting the Undertaker who might be on the verge of retirement and on his last Wrestlemania.

Karina Elias and Kevin Owens

Kevin Owens has been with his wife Karina since long before he joined the WWE.

They have been a together since Owens, then wrestling under his real-name Steen, was competing in small gyms and local bingo halls.

What she does while her hubby is away wrestling is a mystery as the Owens clan keep themselves outside the spotlight.

The former Universal Champion describes her as the “backbone” of his family and the couple have two children together, Owen and Elodie.

They got married in 2007.

Lana and Rusev

One of the WWE's most noticable couples, Rusev and Lana are inseparable both in and out of the ring.

The Ravishing Russian is always seen at the side of the Bulgarian Brute while he hits the ring to crush opponents.

Unfortunately, an injury is keeping Rusev off this year's edition of Wrestlemania but the stunning Lana could still make appearence.

The couple tied the knot last year in a traditional ceremony in his homeland of Bulgaria.

Alexa Bliss and Buddy Murphy

Smackdown Women's Champion Alexa Bliss is dating WWE wrestler Buddy Murphy – but you might not have seen him on television yet.

He still wrestles in WWE's rookie league NXT on the company's network – and was once one-half of the NXT Tag Team Champions with his partner Wesley Blake.

But he has not been around much on NXT since his gorgeous fiancée was called up to the main roster where she was one of the biggest stars on Smackdown.

The Australian is understood to be being ""repackaged"" after the break-up of his team with Blake.

Meanwhile, Bliss will be defending her championship against five other women at Wrestlemania 33.

Natalya and Tyson Kidd

These two have been inseperable since they were 12-years-old and broke into the wrestling industry together.

Natalya and Tyson Kidd met when they were training to be wrestlers at the school run by the legendary Hart family.

They started dating back in November 2001, and finally got hitched in June 2013.

Unfortunately Tyson has been out with an injury after a match with Samoa Joe since June 2015.

It is unknown whether he will ever return to the ring, but Natalya will be fighting tonight at Wrestlemania 33.

The Miz and Maryse

Ready for a match against John Cena and Nikki Bella are fellow wrestling power couple The Miz and Maryse.

Both wrestlers at the top of their game, The Miz is a former WWE Champion while Maryse is a two-time Divas' Champion.

The couple broke into the WWE together after meeting during the WWE's 2006 Diva's Search – which was hosted by The Miz and in which she competed for a contract as a WWE Diva.

After eight years, the couple got married in a lavish ceremony in The Bahamas in February, 2014.","dramatic"

In fact, some of the cheapest and most popular motors could be set to skyrocket in price over the next few years.

Cars like the Mk1 Ford Escort are now worth around £20,000 when you could have picked one up just five years ago for £2,000.

A pristine Mk1 Escort sold at auction for a massive £203,000 last month.

Another of those bookmarked to become a future classic is the Citroen XM.

While the XM didn’t set the world alight with its angular looks and soviet interior when it was released in 1989, it is now becoming more and more collectible nearly 30 years on.

Experts are saying the car’s unique styling and collectibility will make it very desirable in years to come.

Robert Smart, of the Citroën Car Club, said: “Many of the remaining XMs are very well cared for cars in the hands of enthusiasts. As a result, I can see values increasing much further.

“The XM has left the cheap banger doldrums, and prices for very nice examples are on the rise.”

Several other cars have also been touted for a massive rise in price.

The Subaru Impreza, original Fiat Panda and Saab 900 Turbo all look likely to increase in value.

Karl Fasulo, director of KGF Classic Cars, which specialises in these neo-classics, said: “Originality is crucial.”

“Low mileages and few owners will always be more desirable, and sportier variants are the most appealing.

“Early Audi TTs and Ford Pumas, too, will undoubtedly become real classics in a few years’ time.”","dramatic"

Now David Sugarman, who successfully campaigned for Kim to free another US citizen, Kenneth Bae, has taken up Otto’s case.

He’s met with Kim’s UN ambassador, Jang Il-hun, and says talks went well – and he’s even offered to visit North Korea.

But Sugarman, who’s worked as a sports agent for some of basketball’s big names, said Otto’s case is being ignored in the US.

He told Daily Star Online: ""This case, is very different to Mr Bae’s. I’m not referring to the allegations or charges but attention and public awareness.

""When Mr Bae was in a labour camp in North Korea, news outlets were doing weekly stories and updates. They provided what seemed like weekly updates.

""Politicians, celebrities and citizens created a buzz about this story. We all knew and felt it – or at least I did – that he was coming home.""

Mr Sugarman said Otto had been knocked off the agenda by other news about North Korea and Donald Trump, and that he was ""not happy"".

He continued: ""The media in the United States is spending what seems like all their time discussing President Donald Trump.""

""I have attempted to reach out to him and to ask for his support on this issue but to no avail,"" the campaigner added.

""North Korea has been in the news lately but it has nothing to do with Otto… [yet] there is a solution to all of this and it is not war.""

Otto's family has stayed out of the media spotlight since the arrest, seemingly hoping not to inflame the situation further.

And though Mr Sugarman cannot speak for them, he hopes that his efforts will ensure Otto does not slip off the radar.

If you ask a guy where the sexiest place you can touch him is, we can all guess what he’d say. But there is another key spot that often gets forgotten about.

Touching this erogenous zone – which many women aren’t even aware of – will make a guy boil over with excitement.

""Stimulating these spots not only feels terrific for a man, but it also builds sexual tension throughout his entire body and increases blood flow to his genitals,"" said Ian Kerner, PhD, author of Sex Detox.

""This boosts his arousal and intensifies his pelvic contractions, magnifying his orgasm tenfold.""

But where exactly is the male G-spot and how can you stimulate it?

You might have gathered from various teen movies that this key male pleasure zone is in his anus.

However, if you’re a bit squeamish you can actually stimulate it from the outside.

A guy's prostate — the walnut-size gland under his bladder — is the ultimate magic button to push if you want to blow his mind in bed.

To stimulate it you can stroke the swath of skin between his testicles and anus partway through oral sex or intercourse.

""His prostate is situated above your fingers, inside his body,"" Kerner told Cosmo. “So by applying pressure here, you're indirectly rubbing his G-spot.""

When you sense he's close to orgasm, rhythmically press the area every second until he reaches the big-O.

If you’re more adventurous, you can give him an even more intense orgasm by placing your finger in his anus.

The G-spot can be found about two inches in towards the front of his body.

Obviously get his permission first, make sure your finger nails are short and use plenty of lube.","vulgar"

But then you sleep together and there’s nothing. No spark, no sexual chemistry, nothing.

So it’s all over, right?

According to a new study, rather than looking for someone you share sexual chemistry with, you should be looking for a partner who doesn’t tick all the boxes – but has potential.

The study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that the satisfaction we get from sex is influenced by the attitudes we hold about how it should play out with our partners.

Researchers from the University of Toronto and Dalhousie University set out to see if beliefs in sexual destiny or sexual growth had the same impact on sexual satisfaction as believing in relationship growth or destiny had on sexual satisfaction.

In plainer terms, it all depends on whether you hold “growth beliefs” – that problems are just challenges that you and your partner can work through – or “destiny beliefs” – this is when you believe you have just one or two soulmates in the world.

""Sexual growth beliefs indicate that sexual satisfaction requires effort and work to maintain over the course of time in relationships,” the researcher’s defined.

“Sexual destiny beliefs indicate that natural compatibility between sexual partners is the key factor that allows couples to maintain sexual satisfaction, and that struggles in a sexual relationship suggest the relationship is destined to fail.”

So if you believe in “destiny”, “fate” or “the one” this study has said that you are more likely to find less satisfaction in your sex life than those who work through problems and flaws with their partner.

“Individuals high in sexual growth beliefs believe that challenges in their sex life and sexual incompatibilities with their partner can be overcome with hard work,” the authors explained.

“Individuals high in sexual destiny beliefs think that the quality of their sex life will predict their relationship success, meaning they use their sexual relationship as a barometer for how their overall relationship is functioning.""

The authors also noted that is “takes a lot of time and effort to cultivate a good sexual relationship”, so if the sex isn’t fantastic straight off the bat, don’t give up on the relationship just yet.","vulgar"

The most recent National Survey of Sexual Health and Behaviour revealed that less than half of men between the ages of 18 and 24 used a condom during their last sexual encounter.

But the older lads were even worse at rubbering up. Only 30% of guys aged 25 to 34 used protection with their last partner.

Another fresh piece of research from Superdrug Online Doctor, which quizzed 2,000 people, found that a whopping 65% of Americans and 55% of Europeans have had unprotected sex.

Researchers said: “When it comes to Americans versus Europeans, Americans tend to have more unprotected sex by a full 10%.

“While we can only guess as to why this is the case, it might have something to do with the fact that many American men are circumcised whereas European men typically are not.

“In recent years, some studies have shown that circumcision can decrease the risk of certain STDs – incorrectly leading some men to conclude that they don’t need to use condoms.”

They continued: “It is also interesting to note that both American and European women reported using less protection every time than their male counterparts.

""To explain this discrepancy, perhaps men are having sex with more partners overall. Or women are wearing rose-colored glasses.

“It goes without saying that skipping protection regularly is an unnecessary risk, especially when there are confidential services that deliver sexual health supplies to your door.”

And when it comes to wrapping up, you better not buy the wrong sized condom because an ill-fitting sleeve is just as bad as not using one.

If the rubber doesn’t fit your penis properly it could slip off and then you’re at risk of nasty STIs.

So it won’t do you any good pretending you’re a large when you aren’t.

Here’s a handy guide to getting the correct size:

Small condoms are 1.75 inches (4.4cm) in width and 6.3 inches (16cm) in length. Regular condoms are 2.0 inches (5.1cm) wide and 7.9 inches (20.1cm) long. Large ones are 2.12 inches wide and 7.9 inches (20.1cm) long.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/548452/How-to-make-orgasm-last-longer","How to have a longer and more intense orgasm in four simple steps","For women orgasms tend to last anywhere from a few seconds to half a minute – but it is possible to prolong her pleasure and give her a better, stronger climax.

According to sexual health and wellbeing expert Samantha Evans, co-owner of Jo Divine, there are four simple ways to boost her bedroom enjoyment.

She said: “Each woman is different and how women reach that amazing orgasm is entirely dependent on what they find pleasurable.

“Ladies should tell their partners what they want and how they like to be touched – the more he gets to know your body and what turns you on, the more likely you are going to climax.

“Some women have even been known to be able to orgasm from mental thoughts alone.

""By focusing solely on pleasurable feelings and thoughts of desire, women are able to bring themselves to climax and experience powerful mental orgasms.”

Here are Samantha’s top tips for a better, longer big-O:

1. Let go of self-consciousness

Having an orgasm is about focusing on intense pleasure and letting it overcome you, so if she’s finding it hard to orgasm have a think about why this may be.

Is she stressing over a current issue? Is her mind is elsewhere?

There are plenty more reasons as to why women can find it hard to orgasm, but thinking about pleasure alongside physically experiencing pleasure is said to dramatically enhance female orgasm.

2. Use a sex toy

To increase female orgasm, why not introduce a sex toy into the bedroom?

Sex toys are a great way of enhancing and increasing the chances of fantastic orgasms.

It’s fairly common knowledge that 70% of women need clitoral stimulation to achieve an orgasm, so using a clitoral stimulator is a simple yet effective way of enhancing your orgasmic pleasure.

3. Get back to basics

Women who know their own bodies inside out are more likely to have better orgasms and self-exploration is a great way for a lady to enhance her orgasmic pleasure.

Knowing how to touch yourself also makes you a better teacher for your partner during sex play.

In exploring your body with your fingers and touching yourself in various ways, such as stimulating your clitoris through the material of your knickers, you will expand your sexual horizons and discover new ways to achieve an orgasm.

4. Read erotica

The 2014 British Sex Survey found that 53% of women read erotica “at least occasionally” compared to 32% of men, indicating somewhat of a gender divide when it comes to erotic literature.

Erotic writing allows you to let your mind wander, loosing yourself in the story and playing it out in your mind.

In order to avoid arousing suspicion when sneaking off to do the dirty, women have revealed the top alibis they use to keep their infidelity under wraps.

According to new research by extra-marital dating site Gleeden, most ladies pretend they’re off for a girl’s night out when they are actually sneaking off for sex.

The survey, which quizzed more than 18,000 members, found that 66% of women use an “evening out with friends” as their number one alibi.

Other popular lies included “I’m taking some me-time” either shopping or at the spa, or “I have a professional obligation”.

Pumping iron at the gym was a cover-story used by 27% of women, while 11% said they were visiting parents or family.

Meanwhile most women look elsewhere because they want to feel sexy and wanted again.

Here are three signs she’s thinking about cheating:

1. She’s turning 25 or 30 or 35 or...

Decade and half-decade birthdays make women questions their lives, a new study found.

This can sometimes lead to breakups or even episodes of infidelity.

“She’ll think deeply about her love life and its direction, and if it’s not going the way she planned, she might jump at the chance to correct it with an affair,” says Don-David Lusterman, Ph.D., a psychologist and the author of Infidelity: A Survival Guide.

The incidence of birthday cheating triples in women who report being in unhappy relationships, according to a survey by infidelity.com.

2. She does all the housework

A recent study found that 72% of women who took part in a recent study said they cheated because their man didn't do any housework.

More than 10,000 women from all over the world who use the Gleeden – which pairs up people wanting to have affairs – responded to the infidelity poll.

And the study revealed that ladies are much more likely to play away if their partner doesn't lift a finger around the house.

3. Her mother cheated

Women are more likely to cheat if their mothers cheated too, a new study reveals.

You’d think the heartbreak of finding out your mum had cheated on your dad would send you in the opposite direction.

But uncovered Google Earth images could prove the life-forms are already here.

Here, Daily Star Online takes a look at the most compelling pictures.

For years, truthseekers have claimed top-secret US base Area 51 in Nevada holds alien lifeforms and spacecraft.

While this has never been proven, one UFO hunter was stunned when he came across a huge circular object floating strangely close to the base in 2013.

The bright shape bears a startling similarity to common ideas of what alien spacecrafts look like.

It also appears to have a circular shadow – further fuelling claims it is a flying saucer.

But some eagle-eyed viewers pointed out the shape had been “in the exact same position going back as far as 1998”, indicating it could just be a fixed object.

A huge silver disc was spotted at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), near Los Angeles in California earlier this year.

YouTube user, Name Shame, made the bizarre find after tracking movements at the facility over the course of three years.

The Google satellite images revealed the object had moved a number of times within the grounds of the lab – from a patch of grass to the runway.

Conspiracists believe the space agency is hiding alien technology at the lab – and the recent finding has only added to these claims.

Renowned theorists thirdphaseofmooon claimed they found a spaceship hovering in the skies in January – from using Google Street view.

The strange sight – spotted in Louisville, Kentucky – shows a black triangle floating above a residential street.

“It definitely looks like a triangular shaped craft hidden in the clouds,” the narrator explains.

“What’s interesting is if this was a glitch, it would show up in every area of this street.”

But when they looked down the street it wasn’t visible.

Some users were baffled by the sighting – not being able to reach any other conclusion than it being a spaceship.

One viewer, however, offered a different explanation: “It’s an artefact that happens when you mosaic the panoramic photos.”

Back in February, 2016, a YouTube user came across a circular shape floating in the skies of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

It was again taken from Google Street view and specifically was spotted from the ground of a cemetery.

In the background of the image it’s possible to see the famous Christ the Redeemer statue.

Viewers – like all the other photos – had mixed responses.

One claimed it was still unidentified and another stated it bared a strong resemblance to flying saucers.

But others suggested it was simply a bird.

In possibly the most mind-boggling photos of all in this list, theorists claim they found a UFO crash site in Antarctica, guarded by tanks.

Four tank-like objects are lined up alongside each other in the image.

In front of them lies another circular shape – with what looks like a trail behind.

It was posted to YouTube early last year, with the caption: “Antarctica UFO Crash site guarded by tanks revealed on Earth.”

“Some UFO hunters discovered what seems to be a landing or crash site of a mysterious craft that appears to be guarded by four snowy shapes, strongly resembling a battery of tanks,” the narrator says.

She then cuts around one of the cysts and she isn’t wrong, it is the exact shape and colour of an onion.

As she opens up the man’s flesh the massive round ball of white pus bursts from his skin.

“Holy guacamole, get that out of his body,” a woman can be heard saying in the background of the clip.

And if just watching the clip wasn’t enough to put viewers off eating for life, the dermatologist helpfully gave a vomit-inducing description too.

Alongside the video, Dr lee wrote: “The pasty contents of the cyst are mostly composed of macerated keratin (wet skin cells), which creates this ‘cheesy’ consistency and there can be a pungent odor.”

Delicious.

It’s been a couple of weeks since Dr Pimple Popper’s last video when she had fans enthralled with a deluge of pus “like old wet newspaper” pouring out of a man’s skin.

And the moment a man used a DIY knife to cut a cyst that looked “like ricotta cheese” out of his own arm has been thrilling viewers ever since it emerged online last month.","dubious"

He films his speedometer to show how the snake is managing to grip on despite how fast the man is driving.

The giant and deadly snake is the largest on earth – growing up to 20-feet long – and can easily kill a human.

King of the food chain in its native South America, the formidable predator poses a threat to anyone that crosses its path.

But the driver of the car seemed remarkably calm despite his close contact with the terrifying beast.

“No s***s given by the driver – just so casual,” one viewer said.

Skippered by Steph Houghton, our female footballers head off to the Netherlands where they face Scotland, Spain and Portugal in the group stages.

And they have vowed to win it – or at least do better than our men, who were knocked out of last year’s Euros by tiny Iceland.

In fact, our female stars put in the best performance by a senior England side since 1966 when they beat Germany for the first time to come third in the Women’s World Cup two years ago.

Here Nadine Linge meets five of the players gunning for victory on August 6 in Enschede.

Toni

Scouser Toni Duggan, 25, was part of the third-placed World Cup team and admits that success means there’s more pressure on them to deliver this summer.

But the Manchester City star knows these girls can more than deal with that.

She says: “We’re a victim of our own success because with success comes pressure.

“These girls can cope, every one of us plays high-profile games, big competitions and we’ve played at a high level for a long time.

“There’s 19 of us from the previous World Cup squad. Pressure is part and parcel of the sport and any player that wants to be at the top has to be able to handle that.”

With five years of playing for England under her belt, Toni has seen how the team’s success has boosted the game.

“People have been inspired by what we’ve achieved,” she says.

“The more we are seen, the more it gives youngsters a chance to follow in our footsteps.

“Ten years ago, even if the team was successful, it wasn’t known but it’s a lot more accessible now and long may that continue.”

Jade

Notts County midfielder Jade Moore, 27, reckons the squad is just about as close as a group can get – a key factor in being able to win.

She explains: “In any team sport, you’re not going to get a group of 23 girls who all love each other and are best of friends, but actually with us, it’s not far off it.

“That’s powerful. The more you are together and spend time with each other, the more the performance grows.

“We’re going to be training together for six whole weeks and spending time together with the squad. You want to try to create a club feel at international level.

“If you look at our campaign in the World Cup, we grew stronger as we went on and that’s because we were together more.

“That belief grew with it.”

But despite the growing enthusiasm for the sport, Jade acknowledges they are still fighting to get the same interest as the England men.

She says: “Our success in the World Cup drove a lot of popularity and interest. That was our legacy of the World Cup, to inspire a nation. I think we did that.

“Now it’s how we keep that growing. We play good football but we are still fighting to get people to come and watch us.

“We have to fight the battle but it’s easily won if we are successful.”

Steph

Captain Steph Houghton, 28, is ready to lead her Lionesses to victory – and knows they can go all the way.

The Man City defender, who boasts 83 England caps, says: “We’ve got really strong hopes for being successful come July.

“These girls are athletic and physically strong and I think people admire us for being footballers rather than women who play football.

“We’ve just got to enjoy the moment, make sure we wear the shirt with pride and show what we’re about.

“As captain, I’m there to lead by example, on and off the pitch. My role is being the voice for the girls, making sure we’re as happy as we possibly can be.

“We love football and we’re together all the time so it’s important you all get on.

“The majority of the squad have experienced the World Cup, a lot of us have grown up together so you know you can rely on each other.”

Steph, who sees Germany and France as their fiercest rivals, is also looking to what legacy they leave behind.

“We owe it to ourselves to leave the game in a better position when we stop playing,” she explains.

“We want young girls to aspire to be a professional footballer and play for England.

“We take the role-model tag very seriously and it’s great for us to give something back and inspire young girls.”

Nikita

This is Nikita Parris’s first senior tournament and the 23-year-old is over the moon to have made the cut.

And while she recognises the women don’t earn anything like the wages of the male stars, she thinks what’s more important is the love of the game.

“I’m buzzing to be selected, I feel I’ve been waiting for this for so long,” she says.

“Everyone is fighting for each other and we all want great things for each other. We go into every game wanting to win and you have to love the game most of all. We’ve got to work hard on the pitch in these big tournaments to show that women’s football can compete.

“Money is great to have but if you’re not enjoying your job, what’s the point? And money doesn’t help you win.”

Nikita spent eight years at Everton before moving to Manchester City three years ago.

And she’s ready to make her mark at the Euros.

She adds: “No one really knows who I am now but hopefully at the end of the tournament they will.

“We’re going into the Euros confident. I’m ready to come out triumphant with the trophy.”

Ellen

Ellen White, who plays for Birmingham City, says the squad is like a family – and that’s what spurs them on to such great success.

She says: “It’s the togetherness of the team, how we’ve worked on that away from the football pitch.

“We’ve worked on team-building and we want to be like a family.

“When you’re away for a long period of time, the togetherness is potentially what makes or breaks you as a team.

“But ultimately it’s our hard work and dedication as well – we’re professional athletes and we trust and respect each other as footballers.”

Ellen is looking forward to squaring up to Scotland in their first match of the tournament.

The 28-year-old forward, who has 62 England caps and 20 goals, says: “Our biggest rival in our group has got to be Scotland. I know a lot of people in the Scotland team so it’s going to be an exciting game, it’s going to be feisty and passionate.

“Spain and Portugal are also fantastic teams so they are going to be tough opposition for us.

“It’s going to be a challenge, but one we can’t wait for.”

The Squad

Karen Bardsley (Manchester City), Siobhan Chamberlain (Liverpool), Carly Telford (Notts County) DEFENDERS: Laura Bassett (Notts County), Lucy Bronze (Manchester City), Alex Greenwood (Liverpool), Steph Houghton (Manchester City), Jo Potter (Notts County), Alex Scott (Arsenal), Demi Stokes (Manchester City), Casey Stoney (Liverpool) MIDFIELDERS: Millie Bright (Chelsea), Isobel Christiansen (Manchester City), Jade Moore (Notts County), Jordan Nobbs (Arsenal), Jill Scott (Manchester City), Fara Williams (Arsenal) FORWARDS: Karen Carney (Chelsea), Toni Duggan (Manchester City), Fran Kirby (Chelsea), Nikita Parris (Man City), Jodie Taylor (Arsenal), Ellen White (Birmingham City)

US forces have amassed in the area – after US president Donald Trump vowed to ""solve"" North Korea.

It is unclear if American warships were the target – or if it was just a warning shot.

US forces are taking part in a three-day military drill off the coast of Japan to prepare for a possible war with North Korea.

More than 800 troops, several destroyer warships and helicopters capable of taking out nuclear submarines took part in the first exercise yesterday.

North Korea threatened to take ""necessary counteraction"" against the “reckless actions”.

And it seems Crazy Kim is making good on his threat by firing the rocket.

The launch was from Sinpo, a port city on the North's east coast, and the missile flew about 40 miles, South Korea's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a short statement.

Sinpo is the site of a North Korean submarine base.

The launch comes just ahead of a meeting between Trump and China's president Xi Jinping this week – where adding more pressure on the North to drop its arms development will take centre stage.

Any launch of objects using ballistic missile technology is a violation of UN Security Council resolutions but the North has defied the ban as infringement of its sovereign rights to self defence and pursuit of space exploration.

North Korea attempted to launch a ballistic missile two weeks ago from its east coast and earlier in March fired four missiles towards Japan – some of which came as close as 190 miles to Japan's coast.

The reclusive state has also conducted two nuclear weapons tests since January 2016.

The North is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that can hit the US – and Kim has vowed to test-launch one at any time.

Experts and officials in the South and the US believe Pyongyang is still some time away from mastering all the technology needed for an operational ICBM system, such as re-entry of the atmosphere and subsequent missile guidance.

But the test of new, larger rocket engine was hailed as a leap forward by Kim's trigger-happy regime.","dramatic"

War tensions are rising with Pyongyang as Seoul and Washington continue to carry-out massive military drills in the Peninsula.

Forces from the US, South Korea and Japan have begun rehearsing plans to take-out the North's submarines.

Japanese warships and aircraft joined the drills for the first time ever as Tokyo fears a strike from Kim.

North Korea has been ramping up their nuclear programme – test-launching ballistic missiles from submarines as well as questing for an ICBM capable of striking the West Coast of the US.

Drills took place in waters between South Korea and Japan and featured three destroyers, one from each of the allies, and host of helicopters and warplanes.

South Korea's Defense Ministry said: ""The drill was intended to improve the three countries' anti-submarine search, identification and tracking capabilities so as to ensure their effective response to threats from North Korea, which is developing SLBM.""

Kim's submarine fleet is understood to ageing but formidable – deploying 50 vessels as tensions spikes in 2015.

North Korea has also torpedoed the South's vessels – sinking the corvette ROKS Cheonan and killing 46 seamen in 2010.

Pyongyang is also believed to be building more submarines – including a massive new vessel thought to be the North's biggest ever.

Threats have reached an all-time high with the rogue state after a series of missile tests and the murder of Kim Jong-nam – Jong-un's half-brother.

US President Donald Trump has promised to take action against the rogue state and his top men have said war with North Korea is ""on the table"".

The Aussie millionaire lives in an extravagant home with his wife – who he married in 2011 – his girlfriend Nisha and his four children.

He has been nicknamed the “Dan Bilzerian of Australia” thanks to his resemblance to the king of Instagram – with most of his posts online including a string of stunning bikini babes.

He recently opened up about his ridiculous lifestyle, telling Ocean Road magazine: “When you've got one girl, that's one thing. When there's multiple, there's so much going on in my mind.

“In bed, there's four girls as an average. I often don't get much sleep. I think I come up with a new position every week.

“Bedroom time isn't for me, it's to stimulate the girls. To be good in bed it's not about you.""

The Candyman got together with his wife when he “commented on her bum” at his first official Candy Shop party – now infamous affairs involving hundreds of scantily-clad women at his Gold Coast mansion.

Taesha told the magazine she is fine about sharing her husband with a host of other women.

“There have always been other girls. Sometimes they only live here for a few weeks and then move on,” she said.

“Look at social media, you'll see so many girls throwing themselves at him.

“I don't mind – I'm married to him. He has many girlfriends but only one wife.”

Andrea Leadsom, the Government’s environment secretary, is expected to unveil plans later this week to charge diesel motorists as much as £20 a day to get into 35 major cities.

Under the plans, vast areas of major UK towns and cities could be off limits to diesel drivers.

The new charges are thought to apply to both private and commercial vehicles in major urban centres around the country.

This could leave HGV and van drivers with an enormous headache with their travel costs are set to soar.

Diesel drivers in London will also face new penalties.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is expected to announce that from 2019 the most polluting vehicles will be hit with the £12.50 “T-charge” when entering any part of Greater London, inside the North Circular and South Circular roads.

The government is aiming to quell fears over toxic air pollution from diesel vehicles.

A recent study revealed that over 40,000 people a year die prematurely from inhaling diesel fumes.

Nearly 300 doctors, nurses and other health professionals from campaign group Doctors Against Diesel recently signed a letter urging the Government to do more to remove diesel cars.

“Diesel is amidst a very vicious circle at the moment.” Greg Archer, clean vehicles director at campaign group Transport & Environment told Auto Express.

The terrifying incident comes just days after holidaying Brits were issued with a chilling warning that nearby islands of Ibiza and Majorca were placed on high alert in expectation of a killer tsunami.

Tourists were warned that, in the event of a disturbance between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, a tsunami would take just 20 minutes to reach Cartagena, 30 minutes to the Balearic islands of Formentera and Ibiza, and 40 minutes to Minorca.

The tornado started on the south-western coast of the island, impacting the towns of Macarella and Cala Galdana the worst.

Strong winds pulled out trees, including those in the car park of popular hotel Audax, launching them skyward before crashing into the ground.

A falling tree even brought down some stairs, but fortunately, no-one was injured during the incident

Shocking video shows the moment the tornado, which started out at sea, arrived on land.

The tornado is seen crossing the coast before reaching a house where it sends chairs and other garden furniture flying into the air.

A woman filming the video can be heard in the background shouting and screaming.

Another clip shows the damage caused by the tornado, with trees ripped up and dropped in the middle of the road.

Firefighters can then be seen cutting them up in order to free the road up for traffic as residents attempt to clear up the mess left by the devastating storm.

Tornadoes are not often seen for so long on land and usually disappear within a few minutes.

But once they arrive on land, they possess considerable power and can cause untold damage and loss of life.

Thankfully there were no casualties in this instance, although the roof of an electricity station was destroyed and some school buildings were damaged by the strong winds.","dramatic"

New research suggests the small moons orbiting gigantic gas planets may be the top prospect in the hunt for life.

Scientists are already probing moons in our solar system for aliens such as Saturn's worlds of Titan and Europa.

Aliens might exist on Mars-sized moons orbiting colossal worlds elsewhere in our galaxy, boffins claimed.

They laid out the theory in new research paper The Effect of Multiple Heat Sources on Exomoon Habitable Zones.

It lays out how exmoons relationship with their parent star and the sun will allow them to be warm enough for life to thrive.

Exomoons have yet to be discovered and they are very difficult to detect with current technology.

Previously, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has revealed evidence of heat close to the surface of the moon Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, which could possibly by signals of life.

The scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research penned the paper.

They wrote: ""With dozens of Jovian and super-Jovian exoplanets known to orbit their host stars in or near the stellar habitable zones, it has recently been suggested that moons the size of Mars could offer abundant surface habitats beyond the solar system.""

Scientist Rene Heller told Space.com: ""They might have lots of liquid surface water, but their surfaces could at the same time be blotched with devastating volcanoes.

""Nevertheless, we illustrate that they could be habitable given the right amount of tidal heating, and we show at which distances to their planets these moons would need to be.""

NASA launches the James Webb Space Telescope next year which will look for explanets – and could discover exomoons.

However, Heller said the ""ultimate weapon"" in the hunt for alien life will be PLATO space observatory expected to launch in 2024.

Earlier this year, NASA revealed Proxima-B in the Alpha Centuri star system – which is believed to be a prime candidate for life.","dramatic"

Unfortunately, coupled-up ladies are more likely to lie to their partners than single girls.

Research by Dr Ed discovered that 60% of women have faked an orgasm in a new or long-term relationship compared to 40% who have done it during a one-night stand or once married.

So why are women putting on a show in the bedroom?

More than half of ladies (54%) said it was because the sex was taking too long and they didn’t want to hurt their lover’s feelings.

Other reasons women gave for pretending included boring sex, not being in the mood, feeling tired, being too drunk and not being satisfied by a new partner.

But it’s not just ladies who are acting out their pleasure because 28% of lads also lie about reaching orgasm.

As for the guys who pretend to peak, they did it because they were too tipsy to ejaculate or to spare a partner’s feelings.

One in ten men confessed to faking it during a one-night stand after realising they had made a ""mistake"".

Researchers said: “Men and women were more inclined to fake their orgasm when it came to long-term relationships.

“Roughly 31% of respondents told us they were potentially less satisfied but more willing to pretend their sexual adventures with a long-term partner were fulfilling.

“Additional research seems to suggest that women are especially more likely to fake an orgasm with their partner because they don’t want to hurt their feelings.”

They continued: “Men were more likely than women to fake it with a one-night stand, but even a new relationship had 29% of women surveyed admitting they would pull the wool over their partner's eyes at one point or another

“However, both genders were least likely to fake an orgasm after marriage.

“Maybe this is because a permanent partner is the most likely to satisfy you in bed or because once you’re married, there’s no real reason to pretend anymore.”","vulgar"

In fact a recent study by the University of Kentucky which polled more than 14,000 people found that 45% of men want a longer one.

While some guys resort to getting penis enlargement surgery or penoplasty in a bid to boost their confidence in the trouser department, it’s not the only option out there.

In fact researchers in Italy looked at the best non-surgical “male enhancement” options out there and found that it is possible to increase penis size naturally.

Two urological researchers from the University of Turin reviewed research into manhood-lengthening techniques that don’t involve surgery.

After looking into the various low-risk methods, the scientists found that penile traction devices actually work.

The traction method sees men wearing a penile extender to stretch out their schlongs and it has been shown to boost penis size by 1.5cm to 2.5cm or 0.59 to 0.98 inches on average.

Great news, so what’s the catch?

Guys have to use the traction device for a few hours every day, over a period of four months, before seeing any results – which isn’t that realistic for most men.

Experts don’t actually want to encourage lads to use penile extenders either – as most men feel anxious about their size because they tend to overestimate how much other guys are packing down below.

In an exclusive interview with Daily Star Online, schlong plastic surgeon Dr David Alessi warned that lads’ obsession with penis size could be a symptom of a serious psychological problem.

He said: “Most men who think they have a small penis actually don’t.

“Studies vary, but research suggests that the average erect penis ranges from under five inches to just under six inches.

“Most men who think their penis is too small have penis dysmorphic syndrome and would be better off seeing a shrink and not a surgeon.”","vulgar"

Studies have shown women are more likely to cheat if their mothers cheated, and there is even a specific day of the year that people are more likely to cheat.

However, a relationship expert has just revealed that people are more likely to cheat is they have this one type of job.

If your partner is in a high paying job, they are more likely to cheat India Kang told the Daily Mail.

What’s more is they are especially likely to if the feel they are not given the ""respect they deserve"" by their partner.

She added that as long as the partner who has a lower income shows “gratitude and appreciation” for the higher earner, the higher earner is less likely to stray.

“One partner earning more wouldn't necessarily cheat, providing their partner showed them respect, gratitude and appreciation,” India said.

“However, if one partner earns a lot and the other becomes ‘entitled’ or takes their lover for granted or stops being appreciative, the partner is unlikely to stick around.”

India added if the partner with the higher income is the man, then treating them with respect is particularly important.

“Respect for men is like oxygen, men crave respect. If you respect him, he will cherish you.

“Men know it's their role to protect, provide and support. It's the woman's role to receive gracefully, and also to show gratitude and appreciation for his efforts.

“For example, if what he provides is never good enough for her, he's unlikely to stick around. He'll take his efforts elsewhere, to someone who will make him feel valued.

“On a similar note, if she's always nagging, comparing and criticising him, he'll start looking elsewhere. This works the other way around, too.”

India added that if a woman constantly nags or criticises then it is also likely the man will stray.

Gonorrhoea, chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts and syphilis are just a few of the sexually transmitted infections that can spread through oral.

Experts stress that everyone should be using protection when performing the intimate act.

Around 70% of people view oral stimulation as “full blow sex”, according to a study a sexual research centre at the Kinsey Institute in Indiana.

But recent research shows that people are not protecting themselves from STIs when it comes to oral.

The rate of STIs being spread through oral sex is rising, according to the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH).

One of the biggest problems is that people who catch STIs in the mouth and throat can’t be treated in the same way.

In fact, oral is now the main cause of drug-resistant gonorrhea, because the medicine doesn’t work on the throat, meaning it remains in the mouth.

The NHS recommends everyone use a condom when performing oral sex, to prevent disease from spreading.

""Dental dams and condoms can be used as barrier methods to prevent the passing on of STIs during oral sex, and are available free via your local family planning clinic or sexual health service,” Sue Knight, lead nurse of Clinical Governance at young people's sexual health and wellbeing charity Brook told The Independent.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/498870/How-to-last-longer-in-bed-naturally-best-sex-positions-premature-ejaculation","Best sex positions to help men last longer in bed naturally","If you don’t want the party to finish too early then there’s some moves you should use – and one you should definitely steer clear of.

It’s common for women to take longer to reach orgasm than men, so delaying your climax with some strategic positions could boost your sex life and her enjoyment.

But before you begin make sure to indulge in plenty of foreplay because it’ll help loosen you both up, meaning you’ll be less nervous when it comes to the actual act.

Here are the best sex positions to help him last longer in bed:

1. Woman on Top

In case you haven’t tried this position before, it’s when a woman goes on top and straddles her partner.

The move, also known as cowgirl, is great for holding off ejaculation because it gives the woman more control.

It lets her set the speed and if she thinks that you’re getting close, she can lean forward and rest on her elbows.

Not only will that increase the chance of him hitting the G-spot, but it will make the penetration less deep.

Leaning forward also means that you can get more intimate and focus more on kissing and touching.

2. The Cross

For this position, the man has to lie on side facing the woman. Then she lies on her back at a right angle to him, draping her legs over his hips.

It delays the guy’s arousal because he can’t move as easily by being on his side. Having limited motion means the man won’t be able to get carried away or climax too quickly.

The cross is an easy and relaxed position which can also be used to switch things up during a long and steamy session.

3. Spooning

To get into the spooning position you should both lay down facing the same way, with the man’s pelvis a little lower than the woman's.

This manoeuvre puts him in charge, creating shallow penetration and slower motions so he won’t get too excited.

4. Side By Side

This one is similar to the spooning position except you’re laying on your sides facing each other.

It’s a very close and intimate position which won’t get him too overstimulated because the penetration isn’t too deep.

Not only will the sex last longer but you’ll also be able to communicate what feels good face-to-face while both being in control of the situation.

Avoid: Doggy Style

This is when a woman is on her hands and knees and the man penetrates her from behind, but it’s not a good idea because the man has all of the power and leverage.

If you’re trying to prolong your sex session then cut out doggy style because it’ll make him climax too quickly.","vulgar"

A new study of almost 3,000 British men has revealed over half of them feel ready to propose to their partner.

But they have one very good reason holding them back.

Nearly 41% of the respondents who said they felt ready to propose said their financial circumstances was the main thing holding them back – they felt they hadn’t enough money to pay for the ring or the wedding.

It’s no surprise that financial costs are holding men back – an average wedding in the UK costs a staggering £30,000.

The survey of 2,794 British men over 21 who stated they’d been in a relationship for over two years was conducted by UK licensed betting company Lottoland.co.uk.

Participants were initially asked if they felt they were confident that they were with the person they wanted to spend the rest of their life with – 78% said they were.

Half of these men had also picked out the ring they wanted to buy and 37% had planned out the proposal.

They were then asked if they felt ready to propose and if something was holding them back – 48% said this was the case.

The top five reasons for holding back were: not being financially secure enough to afford a wedding or buy a ring (41%), waiting for the perfect time to propose (21%), worried that they love they felt was unrequited (19%), some didn’t feel they could get her father’s permission (9%) and 4% said they had been persuaded not to propose by family or friends.

Those who said that money was the issue were asked if their partner would consider a low budget affair – but 79% said they didn’t want to compromise on the cost of the wedding.

Over two thirds also said they felt “a lot” of pressure from their partners to propose and out of the respondents who said they were holding back 61% said they would most likely propose in the next 12 months.","vulgar"

In fact, some research shows that couples are less likely to class sex without an orgasm as full-on “sex”.

A study into students’ sex lives found that they’d be more likely to view any sexual act as foreplay or a cheeky fumble if they didn’t reach the big-O.

But other people sometimes view the lack of a climax as a sexual problem, failure or dysfunction – which reinforces the idea that sex isn’t “successful” unless it ends in a burst of peak pleasure.

The belief that having an orgasm is essential to good sex has been dubbed the “orgasmic imperative” by scientists, but they think it’s a bad thing because it creates so much added pressure on couples to make sure that both they and their partner are climaxing.

Sex therapists think that the orgasmic imperative is dangerous and potentially destructive to relationships because it makes people view sex more like an activity where something has to be achieved rather than an interaction for pure pleasure and enjoyment.

It leads to both men and women feeling have an orgasm and deliver one to their lover.

So sexperts think you should think less about sex as a means to an end and just relax – because it can have a knock on effect.

The more you worry about not orgasming, the less likely you are to actually achieve one.

This is because worrying about climaxing can be distracting and it can take you “out of the moment” during sex.

To combat it, try to swap feelings of anxiety for ones of pleasure and stop obsessing over the idea that you have to climax during every romp.

Clear your mind and remember sex is still enjoyable whether you achieve an orgasm or not.","vulgar"

But how many women can have multiple orgasms?

However, the respondents said only 49.3% of the time their multiple orgasm is given to them by their partner, while 42.3% is given to them by the man they are cheating on their partner with and 8.5% get them from a one night stand.

However, nearly two thirds of the women said they would stay in a relationship simply because a man could give her a multiple orgasm.

The move comes after the online retailer lost a court battle surrounding in-app purchases.

Having spent three years fighting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on a billing dispute, Amazon has now withdrawn its final appeal.

It will now refund users millions as part of an enforced punishment for flouting the law.

The case surrounded Amazon’s failure to warn parents that free apps downloaded from its store could contain in-app purchases.

As a result, a number of parents were hit by bill shock after letting their kids use their devices.

With many unaware of the potential payment options within, users were hit with sizeable bills for in-app purchases their children had unwittingly made without prior approval.

Courts have now ruled in the FTC’s favour that Amazon did not do enough to warn again these risks.

The Federal Trade Commission estimates that parents were wrongly charged more than $70 million, roughly £55 million, for such unauthorised purchases between November 2011 and May 2016.

Acting Director of FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection, Thomas B. Pahl said: ""This case demonstrates what should be a bedrock principal for all companies – you must get customers' consent before you charge them.

""Consumers affected by Amazon's practices can now be compensated for charges they didn't expect or authorise.""

If you think you’ve been wrongly charged for in-app purchases made by your kids, you might be eligible for a refund.

Amazon has yet to outline its claim procedure for eligible refunds however.

What is clear, however, is that those found to have been affected will be refunded by method of purchase rather than gift cards.

Only purchases made through the Amazon App Store, not just those on Amazon devices, are affected by the ruling.

Amazon isn’t the only app supplier to have been hit my such decisions.

Both Google and Apple have previously been hit by similar cases.

Back in 2014, Apple was asked to refund $32.5 million to customers in its own in-app purchases case with the Federal Trade Commission.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/603245/iPhone-8-release-date-delays-OLED-screen-problems","iPhone 8 Release Date: Delays could see Apple launch pushed back until November","With the Samsung Galaxy S8 now heading to retailers’ shelves, attention has turned to the next big phone on the tech horizon, the iPhone 8.

The most eagerly awaited new iPhone in years, Apple’s next-generation smartphone will mark 10 years of the company’s handset efforts.

Despite the iPhone 8 release date having long been expected to take place the September, latest reports have suggested the phone is now facing delays.

According to latest reports, the next iPhone’s release could be pushed back until November due to manufacturing issues.

The claims come courtesy of Chinese outlet DigiTimes, with the news site suggesting problems with the phone’s panel are to blame for the potential delays.

“There are signs indicating that Apple may delay the launch of its next-generation iPhone to October or even November, instead of September as usual,” the report claims.

Detailing the cause of the delay, the report added: “Technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices.”

Apple has yet to comment on the potential release for its next flagship smartphone.

Recent reports have suggested the iPhone 8 will be Apple’s first phone to adopt an OLED panel.

It’s been suggested that the Cupertino-based company has ordered 70 million such panels from bitter rival Samsung.

OLED screens offer deeper, more immersive blacks and brighter, more natural colours while being less of a drain on your device’s battery.

This is just one of a number of major new features reportedly heading to the eagerly awaited phone.

Elsewhere, the iPhone 8 has been tipped to adopt a new, faster, more power efficient A11 processor and the updated iOS 11 software that’s expected to be the star of the show at June’s WWDC developer conference.

Keeping pace with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8, the iPhone 8 will reportedly adopt new, low light specialising cameras.

The biggest changes, however, are expected to focus on the phone’s design.

It’s been claimed that the iPhone 8 will adopt a new metal-framed, glass-backed body that ditches the phone’s traditional physical home button in favour of a larger, near edge-to-edge panel.","geeky"

Some shops are having to wait months for new stock and are only offering up the few machines they do have available to those who have pre-ordered a console.

Nintendo are trying to desperately get more units on the streets as fans try to lap up a host on new games like the top-rated Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

But American retailer Gamestop, which also serves the UK, is now warning customers it will be hard to find Switch consoles on the High Street for the rest of the year.

Bosses at the firm said that any potential Switch success has not influenced its financial forecasts as it cannot be sure how many units it will be able to secure.

“There’s a lot of excitement about the Switch, but there’s also a lot of caution,” GameStop chief executive Paul Raines told investors.

“We’re very cautious simply because of limited allocation.

""We don’t really have an aggressive forecast built-in for the Switch. We’ve learned with Nintendo not to do that.""

And chief operating officer Tony Bartel added: “The demand is incredibly strong.

""As soon as we get it into stores, it’s out within hours.

""We anticipate that we’ll be chasing supply this entire year.”

GameStop last week reported year-on-year drops in both revenue and income.

It said that weakening games sales due to the aging generation of consoles and a few triple-A flops were the main culprit, along with strong competition from retail rivals
throughout the Black Friday period.

Its senior director of merchandising Eric Bright recently predicted that he thinks Switch could outpace Nintendo’s most successful ever home console.

“The Nintendo Switch is off to a start right now that it could possibly eclipse the Wii,” he said.

“Initial sales on this have been phenomenal.

""I can’t give straight numbers, but I can say we’re seeing one of the highest attach rates of software and accessories to a device that we’ve seen in a long time.”","geeky"

In what was recently described as the “unthinkable”, new data has revealed that Windows software has now been overtaken by Android.

Google’s popular operating system has gone from strength to strength over recent years and is now the most used OS on the planet.

The mobile software has benefitted from a major boom in demand to take top spot and topple Windows after nearly 30 years as number one.

StatCounter, which monitors usage across the world has confirmed that Android took 37.93% of all internet usage across desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile during the month of March 2017.

Windows devices took 37.91%, meaning it was knocked off top spot for the first time since the 1980s.

“The idea of Android almost matching Windows would have been unthinkable five years ago,” said Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter.

“This is a milestone in technology history and the end of an era,

One thing that has driven usage of Android smartphones is the incredible growth in huge markets such as China and India.

It's not all bad news for Microsoft as the firm still has 400 milllion active Windows 10 users - that figure is four times bigger than Apple's Mac operating system.

Adding a further layer of excitement to the fight for top spot, both Microsoft and Google are currently working on new versions of their globally dominant operating systems.

While Microsoft is finalising, ‘Project Neon’, a new-look Windows 10 offering, Google is getting ready to unveil Android 8.0 at its annual Google I/O gathering in May.

Microsoft is reportedly prepping a number of stylistic changes and improvements, included enhanced animations to Project Neon, with the system’s 3D functions and HoloLens abilities tipped to be upgraded.

Android O will add a range of cosmetic and feature updates, with the ability to use drawable gestures mooted to make an appearance.","geeky"

Then she’ll return to Aintree with boyfriend Tom Mairs, 30, for a flutter on Saturday’s big race.

The hockey ace, 28, who scooped a gold gong at the Rio Olympics and starred on ITV’s I’m A Celebrity has a secret love of the gee-gees and is looking forward to a “really girly day out”.

A local lass from just over the River Mersey on the Wirral, she’ll be handing out the coveted style award.

And she says of her debut at the festival: “This is going to be my first Grand National and I really can’t wait. Normally I’m away training or we’ve got matches… I’m so, so excited.”

Sam’s family also own some horses and she says: “I have always been a big horse racing fan.”

But she isn’t the only one giving the sport a new, glitzier image as jump racing gears up for the biggest event in its calendar.

Horseracing has been undergoing a revolution, boosted by celebs, a surge in female fans and a new swathe of feisty women making their mark as jockeys.

Double Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton, 36, swapped cycling for steeds as she began a new career as a jockey, competing at the Cheltenham Festival.

She reckons there are now more opportunities in equine sports than in cycling, adding: “There are lots of very strong women.” One of those is Lizzie Kelly, 23, who became only the second woman ever to race in the Gold Cup at the Cheltenham Festival last month.

She believes women are beginning to show their mettle in the so-called Sport of Kings, saying: “I think it’s fabulous there’s a jockey who is a female in the Gold Cup.”

Then there’s Irish-born Katie Walsh, 32, who is poised to ride in this Saturday’s Randox Health Grand National, having already come third on Seabass in 2012 – the best performance by a woman in the four-mile steeplechase ever.

But Katie doesn’t expect any favours out on the course because she’s a woman.

In the run up to this week’s action she told the Daily Star: “There’s a lot of chat about women in racing this season and some good results.

“I love what I do and I don’t feel like I am any different to anyone else that does it.

“You’d just love to win the Grand National whoever you are, man or woman – it’d be a fairytale.”

Racing was the second most attended sport in Britain in 2016 with six million fans going to meetings.

And 39% of those are women – a higher figure than in other top sport.

The numbers have no doubt been helped, in part, by the hoards of celebrity fans eagerly grabbing their race cards in recent years.

You’d expect the likes of Zara Tindall, 35, to be snapped at races like the Grand National.

But a new breed of showbiz punter has emerged over the last few years with Coleen Rooney, 31, TV’s Jorgie Porter, 29, and Kym Marsh, 40, among the legions of famous faces being spotted at Aintree.

Other celeb fans include X Factor’s Simon Cowell, 57, motoring guru Jeremy Clarkson, 56, and singer Lily Allen, 31.

And some haven’t stopped at having a wager – many are investing in their own thoroughbreds too. Football’s big names were some of the first to get involved in buying racehorses such as Sir Alex Ferguson, 75, and ex-England star Michael Owen, 37.

But now cricket legend Freddie Flintoff, 39, actor James Nesbitt, 52 and TV legends Ant and Dec, both 41, have also got in on the act.

Meanwhile, the nation’s top musicians are queuing up to perform at Aintree, which attracts 150,000 racegoers over three days.

The Lightning Seeds play on Thursday, the first day of the festival, and singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 37, will perform on Ladies’ Day.

Laura Wright, 26, the famous sporting soprano who will sing the national anthem before the Grand National, says: “The event brings together both my love of sport and my love of fashion.

“Ladies’ Day is such a colourful day and it is wonderful seeing so many women really make the effort to look stylish and glamorous.”

With 600million people tuning in around the globe for the Grand National and £250million bet on the race itself, it’s no wonder Sam Quek is feeling excited.

The clip shows a series of voluptuous women attempting to win favour with the audience – by wearing the smallest bikini possible.

While the premise sounds simple, the range of raunchy swimwear on offer highlights the difference in style and sex appeal between the three competitors.

The first woman – a gorgeous brunette – dons a skimpy red one-piece that barely covers her nipples before plunging down to her privates and flashing a healthy peek at her pert derriere.

But the next contestant decides to go for something more modest to cover her breasts while going all-out on flashing the flesh downstairs.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/602885/Broadchurch-real-residents-reveal-whodunnit","The real residents of Broadchurch reveal who they think 'dunnit'","So no wonder Broadchurch’s crime-fighting duo DI Alec Harvey and DS Ellie Miller (David Tennant and Olivia Colman) look so grim-faced at the prospect of solving this mystery.

Monday night’s episode was watched by a whopping 8million viewers and each week the investigation into the brutal rape of local resident Trish Winterman (Julie Hesmondhalgh) in the tiny seaside town seems to widen.

But what do the real-life residents of Broadchurch – filmed in West Bay on Dorset’s Jurassic coast – think of the smash-hit show?

I travelled to the picturesque filming location for the award-winning series to try to crack the case – and everyone I spoke to had a theory whodunnit.

Despite the grim nature of the show – first the murder of schoolboy Danny Latimer in series one and now the brutal rape of Trish in series three – the beach is still busy with a mixture of tourists and locals enjoying the balmy weather.

And there is only one topic of conversation...

Jan Sumner, 62, from Weston-superMare, Som, is enjoying a sunny day at the beach with her husband.

Both are superfans of the show so decided to visit the famous location in a bid to solve the mystery.

She says: “It’s driving us mad – we can’t figure it out. Every time I watch it I change my mind. Right now I think the taxi driver Clive did it. He’s just weird isn’t he?

Jules Collins, 50 and Andrew Cook from Cheddar, Som, work supporting local , 50 people with learning difficulties.

Jules says: “We’re all talking about it round here.

“I think it’s her ex-husband Ian Winterman. He went off with another lady from the school and that didn’t work out, and you can tell he hates the way Trish has moved on. He probably did it to still have control over Trish and think that she’s still his. He’s acting really shifty.”

Kirsten Beckie, 48, and daughter Amber, 13, from Yeovil, Som, are enjoying fish and chips on the beach.

Nursing home worker Kirsten says: “It’s definitely her ex-husband Ian Winterman – he’s acting really weird. We need to know what is on his laptop. He is obviously scared of the police getting hold of it. I think Lenny Henry (shopkeeper Ed Burnett) is a red herring – it won’t be him this early on. They’ve arrested the wrong man there.”

Paul Scott, 44, and his daughters Georgia, 15 and Sophie, 16, are from nearby Yeovil.

They discuss the show while enjoying a sunny day with ice creams on the seafront.

“We love it – everyone we know is talking about the show,” says engineer Paul.

“We come to West Bay a lot anyway but it’s definitely got a lot busier as so many fans of the show want to come and see where it’s filmed. It’s nice.

“We think it has something to do with Leo Humphries, who works in the blue rope factory and the blue rope was used to commit the crime. He’s already asked his girlfriend to lie to the police for him. But he said it was his dad’s factory, not his. So where is the dad? There’s also the old man who owns the mansion where the party was held – that could be something.”

Frances and Bob Ciardini, 52 and 53, from nearby Swanage, Dorset, also have their theories.

Frances works as an Anatomical Pathology Technologist – which means she performs post mortems, so she is not shy of a crime investigation herself.

She says: “I’m really enjoying this series, it’s the best one yet.

“I think it’s too obvious to be the cabbie. I reckon it has something to do with Jim Atwood, her friend’s husband. He’s really dodgy.”

Bob, a bus driver, isn’t so sure.

“I have no idea – we might not even have met the perpetrator yet.”

Show superfans Barbara Novo and Colin Dawes , 32, and , 45, have travelled to West Bay from London today to see if they can crack the crime.

“I just love the show so really wanted to come and see where it’s filmed,”

Barbara, a nanny, says. “It’s beautiful here and looks just as good as it does on screen. I don’t think it can be Trish’s ex-husband Ian – that would be too obvious. I think there’s a whole group of people involved and it will all come together by the end.”

Tom Marley, 27, runs the local Angling Centre in West Bay.

He worked with Broadchurch crew and supplied sea fishing equipment and boats used in the show.

Tom says: “Aaron Mayford is one of the suspects who didn’t have an alibi because he said he’d been fishing for mackerel overnight on the beach. But I told producers that mackerel are visual feeders so you can only fish for them in the day – it would be impossible at night. So he is definitely lying about where he was and what he caught.

“The scenes on the water this week were filmed in my boat which the crew hired out. I personally think Tom Miller, Ellie’s son, is involved. It’s definitely got something to do with the children.”

Ellie Norris, 22, from nearby Bridport, works as a Harbour Assistant and Merchant Navy Nautical Officer.

She says: “It was the taxi driver Clive Lucas – he’s lied about everything so far. But Cath’s husband Jim Atwood also bothers me. He’s such a predatory character. Thankfully West Bay is nothing like Broadchurch – it’s much calmer!

“This is such a beautiful area and I’m so glad the show reflects that. I’m also pleased with how the complexities of a rape case are being portrayed, I hope it helps others come forward.”

Helen Sawyer, 50, and Alfie Crow, 19, work on the seafront selling ice-creams to hungry tourists.

They both have discussed the show at length with their customers.

“We think it’s the vicar,” says Helen.

“We’ve talked about it so much and he’s been acting really strange.

“He’s definitely hiding something or knows more than he’s letting on.”

She adds: “We’re delighted with the attention Broadchurch has brought to the area – business is booming.”

Sarah Cunningham, from Kingston, Surrey, owns a holiday home in West Bay and says it’s packed out thanks to the hit ITV show.

She is also a fan. She says: “I think it could be her ex-husband Ian Winterman. I just have a feeling about him, it’s usually the person you least expect in these types of dramas.”

Cleo Lawrence, 18, from Bridport works in Snack Shack on the seafront opposite Helmet City and the fictional police station. She served coffees to the Broadchurch cast and crew during filming.

Cleo says: “They were all so nice. Olivia Colman was lovely! It was really sunny and she had to carry an umbrella with her to stop her getting a tan. Lenny Henry was brilliant too.

“It was really hectic whilst they were filming as so many people crowded round to watch and all the roads were shut – it’s exciting. We all think it was the taxi driver Clive Lucas – he was really horrible to his son, and his son is involved with Tom Miller and the mobile pornography. That is a huge clue I think.”

Will Howard, 44, works as a salesman at Helmet City, a motorcycle supplies store on West Bay, and lives locally.

He explains that the circular stock room for Helmet City was taken over by Broadchurch producers to use as the setting for the show’s famous police station.

He says: “It was chaos whilst they were filming as they shut off all the roads and people all gathered round to watch what was happening.

“Even now we get loads of tourists at the weekend come and pose for pictures outside the building. It’s obviously not a real police station, it’s just our stock room! Lots of the scenes were outside my shop so I saw lots of it happening and met both David and Olivia, who were really nice.

“I think Lenny Henry’s character Ed Burnett did it, to be honest with you. That’s the gist I’ve got from the filming I saw and the episodes so far. Which is a shame, as I really like Lenny Henry, but his character in the show is a bit of a stalker.”","boorish"

Within minutes, a supermassive black hole could obliterate all life on Earth, and scientists have no idea when it could happen, experts have claimed.

But now, a new telescope will be used to try and gain some insight into the monstrous black hole at the very centre of our solar system – the Milky Way.

The massive celestial phenomenon is a whopping four million times bigger than the Sun.

No photographs from the inside of a black hole will ever be able to exist as light cannot make it out.

But groundbreaking technology in the Event Horizon Telescope will attempt to look at two supermassive black holes – one in the centre of our galaxy and one in the nearby M87 galaxy.

“It rips off the Clark Kent business suit and starts to become as strong as the other forces.”

Watford Borough Council started probing Panayides after a tip-off that she had an income from the firm, Adult Work.

They’d also been told that she was working as a dancer at Diamonds & Strings, a gentleman’s club in Market Street, Watford.

Adult Work, an internet company based in Malta, confirmed Panayides had worked for them and supplied details of the dancer’s earnings.

Fraud investigators also obtained her bank statements covering a 13-month period, which showed no less than £22,000 had been paid into her account.

Panayides, whose film credits include Pornstars Like It Big 7 and Let's Get Slippy, got her council tax slashed from April 2015 to May 2016.

She was interviewed under caution in March 2016 and the allegations were put to her, before she was eventually summoned to court.

She failed to attend her hearing on Wednesday last week, where she was found guilty of fraud and ordered to cough up £1024.

Panayides, who also claimed dole money, had another claim for social security benefits between March 2015 and May 2016.

“I’ve been gone for about a month over here, in training for the marines and she thinks it’s ok to play behind me.”

So the lad took drastic steps and set up a fake Facebook account to catfish his own girlfriend.

He tricked her into thinking she was chatting to a stranger – but all along it was him.

“She thinks she’s about to FaceTime this guy on Facebook, but it’s me,” the lad tells the camera.

When his girl picks up the phone, the man says: “Hi, do you want to play this game?

“You didn’t think it was going to be me, did you?”

The woman quickly hangs up the phone before the marine turns to the camera looking red-faced from the brief encounter.

He attempts to call again but is unsuccessful, telling his pal filming: “Whatever, plenty more fish in the sea.”

These apply if drivers are caught doing between 21-30mph in a 20mph zone, or between 31-40mph in a 30mph zone.

Band B – 100% of weekly income – and band C – 150% of weekly income – kick in for more serious offences.

A speed awareness course for first offenders may also be offered for minor offences.

Band C offences are punishable by disqualification for seven to 56 days or six points on your licence.

Figures shows almost a million people a year in the UK are handed speeding fines.

District judge Richard Williams, a Sentencing Council member, said: “The magistrates’ courts deal with the vast majority of offenders in England and Wales, so it is essential that the guidelines they use are up to date and help ensure that sentences are applied consistently and effectively.”

RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams welcomed the change on speeding.

He said: “Anyone who breaks the limit excessively is a danger to every other road user and is unnecessarily putting lives at risk.

“Hopefully, hitting these offenders harder in the pocket will make them think twice before doing it again in the future.

“While greater sentences for excessive speeders are obviously a deterrent, the best deterrent of all is more effective enforcement.”","dramatic"

The ladies wore just black bikini bottoms and white crop tops as they paraded their assets for the judges.

The competition went ahead despite critics claiming it objectifies women and promotes “macho violence”.

José Guerrero, director of studies at the Observatory Against Street Harassment in Chile, said: “We have to understand violence as a complete circle.

“Although feminicide is the most visible, there are many small things, such as this gala, that cement the place where violence is going to continue to be generated.

""There is something that tells the girls that it is okay for another person to evaluate their body, that there is a canon that is good and that if someone does not value it positively there is something wrong with it.”

But one of the contestants Maria Eugenia Vegas disagreed, saying the dazzling display of bums urges men to respect women.

She said: “This type of contest emphasizes what woman evokes, which is sensuality.""

It comes after a similar competition in neighbouring Argentina was suspended after sparking outrage from feminist groups.

Miss Reef Argentina 2017 was shelved after the brutal rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl fuelled the criticism.

But the organisers of Miss Reef Chile vowed to go ahead with the contest, saying they would focus on the contestants’ lifestyles as well as peachy behinds.

Reef Chile marketing manager Felipe Gonzalez said: “Miss Reef is a competition that as well as the physical attributes of the candidates, looks for them to be a reflection of the values of the brand.

The 19-year-old had skin grafts from his forehead attached to his nose in a bid to repair the damage.

But he still faces a further three ops over the next eight months.

And in a double blow, the surgery has left Aiden unable to appreciate a joke – because the tight stitches in his face make it feel like it ""pulls apart"".

The tiny terrier bit a ""chunk"" off the teen's nose as he stroked it last November.

But despite his shocking injuries, magistrates ruled the dog should NOT be put down.

Since the attack Aiden told how he has been ""trapped"" at his home in Houghton Regis, Beds.

And he bravely revealed how people staring at his wounds and bandages made him feel like ""a freak"".

Aiden said: ""I feel self-conscious being face to face – I feel I'm being stared at quite a lot.

""Sometimes it makes me feel down a bit, obviously with what I'm having to go through.

""They glued my forehead together so it's really tight.

""If I'm laughing at all it feels like the stitching is pulling apart.""

The rescue dog, named Milo, launched himself at Aiden without warning during the shock attack.

""I started to stroke him on the side of the neck and as I lent in further – I was about a foot away from him – he just lunged forward and bit me on the end of my nose,"" he revealed.

""My first reaction was to pull away... after I had done that I was in a bit of shock.

""Literally I just looked in the mirror and could just see my whole nose from the bottom was red, all around my mouth was red and it was all going on the floor. It was quite heavy bleeding.""

The dog's owner Stephen Taylor was fined £120 and ordered to pay £150 in compo.

He was also ordered to pay a further £135 in court and prosecution costs.

But the former warehouse worker hit out at the ""disgusting"" amount he was awarded.

""The court actually got more in court costs than I did,"" he said.

""If it was a two-year-old that this happened to, you would have a death,"" Aiden added.

And he claimed he had lost thousands in earnings after being left unable to work due to the risk of infection.

He added: ""This is something that's going to stay with me for the rest of my life possibly.

""I've lost well over £5,000 since I haven't been working, £150, that's a real insult to be fair.

""It seems like no one really cares.

""Things have definitely been put on hold at the moment. I loved working and now I'm trapped at home.""

Taylor, 53, of Houghton Regis admitted keeping a dangerous dog that injured Aiden at his home.

He denied his dog was dangerous and claimed Aiden ignored his warnings he was going to be bitten at the time.

""I wasn’t happy because I didn’t want to pay the guy (Aiden) any money what so ever,’ he said.

""It’s no fun having part of your nose ripped off but if he hadn’t have started it in the first place there would have been no issue.""

The CCTV footage was captured at a Dunkin’ Donuts shop at around 10am on Sunday (April 2).

But investigators say it's important they talk to those involved to find out exactly what happened.

The terrifying video shows a man approaching the pram while the baby’s carer has her back turned.

It is not yet known whether the woman is the child’s mother.

The man then puts his hands on the infant inside the buggy for a number of seconds before the woman notices and chases the man out of the store.

“What we see in the video is what appears to be an attempt to abduct a baby,” Philadelphia Police Captain, Sekou Kinebrew, said.

“We want to make sure we act appropriately if a crime did occur and we don't want to leave the public open to someone who may be doing these crimes repeatedly.”

Police were called to the scene by a witness but when officers arrived the baby and woman involved were gone.

Penises come in all shapes and sizes and there really isn't such thing as ""normal"" as every body is different.

However, up until now the average erect penis has measured around 5.2 inches (13.2cm) in length and 4.6 inches (11.7cm) in circumference.

But the Millennial Sex Survey 2017 conducted by condom brand SKYN has revealed something alarming – men’s penises seem to be getter bigger.

Maybe it’s evolution or maybe they’re just exaggerating, but the average millennial’s wang is between 6.1-7 inches (15.494-17.78 cm) when fully aroused.

The results were based on an online survey of 3,037 18-34 year-olds, who have been sexually active in the last three months.

But do women really care about the size of your schlong?

Unfortunately for most men, women prefer a bigger penis, according to research by the University of California Los Angeles and the University of New Mexico.

The study revealed that women prefer a penis that is 6.3 inches long with a 4.8 inch girth for long-term relationships.

When it comes to one-night stands, she wants a whopping 6.4 inches in length and a 5 inch circumference.

The enlightening study also revealed that millennials are having more orgasms, with 48% of males and 44% of females having two or more orgasms during a sex session.

While we know women can have vaginal (G-spot) and clitoral orgasms – the two most common kinds of orgasm – along with anal, cervical, A-spot and even nipple orgasms, the “super orgasm” is a new phrase on the scene.

But what is a super orgasm?

According to new research, a super orgasm is the term used when a woman has 100 orgasms in a row.

Researchers say every woman is capable of enjoying this magical multiple orgasm, but you need to do three things to acieve it – relaxation, yoga and bonding.

The study was part of a Channel 4 documentary called The Super Orgasm. The show measured five women’s brain activity and found not only are women capable of multiple orgasms, they can have 100 in a row.

It also found that some women find it easier to have multiple orgasms as they release a higher level of oxytocin – the chemical that makes you happy – than those who find it more difficult.

One of the subjects, 52-year-old Beverly is the teacher of a tantric class that involves yoga and another participant Francesca attributed her super orgasms to having sex with a partner who she’s bonded with – hence the three things you need to achieve the elusive orgasm.

While the sample group used for the study is small, being more relaxed during sex has been proven already to help you achieve more orgasms – just maybe not 100.","vulgar"

A new survey by the Daily Star Online asked readers ""What is your biggest turn off in a man?"" and the answers might suprise you.

A whopping 35% said a man who smells bad is their biggest turn off.

Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, a dating site for people looking for an affair, Sigurd Vedal said that smell is something you can easily control.

He added, “There’s no doubt that the scent of a lover is a strong emotional and sexual trigger – years after an affair has ended, you never forget how delicious they smelled.

“You can’t really control how you look, but you can control how you smell – and that’s a huge win, as we’ve revealed what the preference is for men and women across the globe.”

Having an arrogant personality came in second with 22% of respondents revealing they preferred men who were kind.

And while prior research has shown women don’t care about the size of a man’s penis, our survey revealed 20% of women would be put off if a man had a small schlong.

The survey, of 804 women, also found that 14% would be turned off by someone who is bad in bed and 9% would be repulsed by wonky teeth.

A new study has even revealed that 68% of women have faked an orgasm and that women in long-term relationships are more likely to fake an orgasm than those who are dating.

So what can you do to make sure she reaches the big-O?

Here we reveal seven sex positions that pretty much guarantee her an orgasm:

1. Table for two

Using the kitchen table for a little change of scenery, the woman will lie down on the table with her butt near the edge. He will be standing next to the table and can enter her while holding her hips and legs for leverage.

This position also gives the man easy access to stroke the woman’s clitoris.

2. The sit and straddle

For this position the man will sit and the woman will straddle him – hence the name.

You will be face to face and the woman will have a lot of control over the speed and angle of the happenings as she can user her arms and legs to help her manoeuvre.

By leaning back a little bit the woman will get more internal stimulation and this will allow her breasts to align with his mouth, so he could even attempt to give her a nipple orgasm – yes it’s possible.

3. On top of the world

The one’s similar to reverse cowgirl except the woman puts her legs together and has her feet flat between his lags.

This means the fit is tighter which makes the sensations more intense – plus there’s increased internal stimulation from this angle.

4. The leg wrap

For when you’re a bit tired but still want to get it on, the woman will lay on her back while the man lies on his side turned towards her. The woman will swing both legs over his hips and thighs and make a bridge shape over them.

This will allow him to gently thrust her and either of you can play with her clitoris from this angle.

5. The sweet spoons

Another relaxing position, but one that allows you to combine two of your favourite things: spooning and sex.

The man and woman will both lie on their sides and rather than thrust in and out, the man should stay inside her and gently thrust against the front walls of the vagina.

6. The down but not out

For this position the woman will lie on her stomach and lift her butt slightly so the man can enter from behind.

The man can lie on top of the woman or prop himself up slightly in a push up position. This allows the woman to gently grind her clitoris against the bed adding extra stimulation.

7. The up and over

While in missionary position, the woman needs to put a pillow under her butt, lift up her hips and bring her legs up and back towards her shoulders.

This allows for deeper penetration and when the woman is close to climax, she needs to put her legs down so that the man can get into coital-alignment-technique which is where he lifts his pelvic bone upward to align with her clitoris.","vulgar"

But when they stem from people who have actually been to space, their accounts take on more validity.

Here Daily Star Online looks at four of the most remarkable claims from NASA astronauts.

Edgar Mitchell spent nine hours walking on the moon, as a Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 14 in 1971.

When he left the space agency, he publicly expressed his opinion that “aliens have been observing us and have been here for some time”.

He claimed the US government regularly covered up alien sightings, going back to the infamous 1947 Roswell incident – where many claim a “flying disc” crashed into the New Mexico town and an alien body was recovered.

“The reason for the denial is they didn’t know if they [the aliens] were hostile and they didn’t want the Soviets to know so they devised to lie about it and cover it up,” he said in an NBC interview in 1996.

Leroy Gordon Cooper Jr – better known as Gordon Cooper – was one of the first people to travel in space, as part of NASA’s Project Mercury between 1958-1963.

He also strongly believed in the existence of aliens – after experiencing them first hand.

In 1951 – while he was flying for the US Air Force – he witnessed a vast amount of UFOs flying at extremely high altitudes.

The experience continued with him after his time as an astronaut and he became so adamant in their existence that he addressed a United Nations panel in 1985.

“I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which are a little more technically advanced than we are on Earth,” he told them.

Like Cooper, Deke Slayton was aboard the first human spaceflight program of the United States – Project Mercury.

He later served as NASA’s Director of Flight Crew Operations but it was an encounter in 1951 that stuck long in his memory.

While testing out a military plane over Minnesota, he saw what he thought was a “flying saucer”.

“It looked like a saucer sitting at a 45-degree angle,” he said of the incident.

“I didn’t have any cameras otherwise I would have shot some pictures.

“At that time – for whatever reason – it just took off climbing and just accelerated and disappeared.”

Brian O’Leary never actually made it to space – but was the first astronaut specifically selected for a potential mission to Mars in 1967.

That never happened, but it didn’t stop O’Leary from being convinced of the extra-terrestrials.

“There is an abundance of evidence that we are being contacted,” the scientist said in a documentary in 2011.

“Civilisations have been visiting us for a very long time and that their appearance is bizarre from any kind of traditional Western point of view.”","dubious"

The psychology student’s disappearance has sparked international interest after a bizarre video of his bedroom was leaked online.

The seriously freaky footage shows he had transformed his room into a kind of shrine, covering his walls with a coded writing and installing a huge statue of philosopher Giordano Bruno.

Giordano Bruno was one of the first thinkers to predict the existence of extraterrestrial life – and some have suggested the boy was trying to complete his work.

Police investigating Bruno’s disappearance say “all possibilities are being considered”.

Weird signs associated with Satanism and the Illuminati covered the floor.

And an eerie self-portrait of the boy with an alien was found on the wall.

The creepy coincidences have sent the internet into meltdown – and led some to speculate Bruno has been taken away in a UFO.

Bruno had been working on a secretive project before he vanished.

Relatives say he was constantly asking them for funding for the scheme – but refused to give details apart from saying he was writing a series of books that would “change humanity in a good way”.

Fourteen bound manuscripts – each with a Roman numeral on it – were found in the room.

They were written in the same code as that on the walls.

Police have reportedly confiscated the volumes.

But a photograph that allegedly shows one page of one of the books has appeared online and has been “decoded” by a Brazilian computer expert.

One passage supposedly says: “It is easy to accept what you have been taught since childhood and what is wrong.

“It is difficult, as an adult, to understand that you were wrongly taught what you suspected was correct since you were a child.

“In other words, if you fit into the system, your behaviour will be determined, making you at the mercy of beliefs already provided and well established in dogmas and rituals, with the masses.”

Bruno was last seen by his family when they had a meal in their town of Rio Branco, in the state of Acre, before his parents went away travelling.

When his parents returned almost a month later, they opened up his room to find he had removed all his furniture and covered the walls with the writing, symbols and pictures.

According to Bruno’s older sister Gabriela, Bruno had kept his room looked for 24 days while his parents were out of town.

She said: ""He said it was his project, I questioned him because I, as a sister, didn’t know what the project was and he told me that he would tell me what it was in two weeks.

“He was an adult and it was his privacy.

""It bothered me, but I couldn’t exactly break down the door.”

Bruno’s mum Denise said her son Bruno had been working on his secret project since 2013.

She said: “He only told me that he was writing 14 books that would change mankind in a good way.

“He wanted to patent them because he had created a new theory.

“He asked me for help and I said I would read them.”

She reportedly admitted Bruno was interested in extraterrestrial life.

A post about the mysterious case on website Reddit has been viewed thousands of times.

Many netizens suggest the boy has gone mad and ran away after cracking.

But his mum insists he was totally sane.

She said: “He was clever. In school he always different – a born leader with high powers of persuasion.

“He is such a kind-hearted boy.”

His parents feared he had been kidnapped.

But they are now convinced his disappearance has something to do with his mysterious project and have asked for help cracking the code.

Some internet users have pointed out the statue is standing on a so-called ""transmutation circle"" – a symbol used by alchemists to try to transform substances from one sort into another.

This has led to a wacky theory that Bruno has somehow transformed himself into the statue of Giordano Bruno.","dubious"

The online retailer has confirmed it has blocked sales of all media player that can be used to access pirated streams and copyright-protected material for free.

Although the online retailer has never openly permitted the sale of such devices, users have been able to find them on the digital shelves of the US company.

The company has confirmed that retailers that float the new regulations could have stocked held within Amazon’s fulfilment centres destroyed.

The move is the latest step in an increased effort to block the rise of copyrighted content from software-enhanced set-top and streaming boxes.

Kodi is one example of software that can be used to power these “pirate” media players.

Although Kodi itself is perfectly legal software that lets users access all of their legitimate online content in a single place, it can be built on by third-party add-ons.

These software plug-ins, allow users to access a variety of pirated and copyright-protected content without paying, floating a number of laws in the process.

Although Kodi doesn’t actually make the hardware, the third-party devices have colloquially been dubbed Kodi boxes.

It is estimated that more than 20 million devices currently run Kodi software in the UK.

Although the best known, Kodi is far from the only software to offer such services.

Amazon’s latest move is targeting those who are selling the enhanceable hardware.

“Products offered for sale on Amazon should not promote, suggest the facilitation of, or actively enable the infringement of or unauthorised access to digital media or other protected content,” the retailer has stated.

“Any streaming media player or other device that violates this policy is prohibited from sale on Amazon.”

Speaking with sellers, the retailer added: “It is your responsibility to source and sell products that do no promote, promise the facilitation of, or actively enable the infringement of or unauthorised access to digital media or other protected content.

“If you sell these products, we may immediately suspend or terminate your selling privileges and destroy inventory in our fulfilment centres without reimbursement.

“In addition, if we determine that your account has been used to engage in fraud or other illegal activity, remittances and payments may be withheld or forfeited.”

Amazon is not alone in its anti-piracy push, the Premier League recently took a hard stance against those streaming its matches without paying.

Speaking to The Guardian, a spokesperson for the Premier League said: “The Premier League is currently engaged in its largest ever anti-piracy campaign to protect its copyright.

“Like other sports and creative industries our model is predicated on the ability to market and sell rights and protect our intellectual property.

""It is because of this that clubs can invest in and develop talented players, build world-class stadiums, support the English football pyramid and schools and communities across the country – all things that fans enjoy and wider society benefits from.”","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/603689/Google-Maps-update-Map-Maker-feature-ditched","Google Maps just ditched one its most useful features and there’s no way to get it back","Google Maps is constantly evolving, offering ever more accurate maps and new, more user-friendly features.

It just made the unusual decision to drop one of its most useful features, however.

The Google Maps feature that’s been shown the door in is the Google Map Maker functionality.

The powerful editing suite let Google Maps users build roads, correct terrain, landmarks and create buildings from scratch to bring the in-app content up to date with real world developments.

In order to stop users abusing the tool, submitted additions were added to a moderation queue.

Google Maps community members would then decide if the edits were necessary and correct, and if so, updates to the map data were rolled out in the software’s continuous background patches.

It wasn’t always a foolproof system though, with an Android logo uniting on an Apple logo once hitting the service.

Now, however, the search giant has ditched the feature entirely.

Although some functionality has been migrated to the mobile versions of the service, the ability to build completely new roads and builidngs has been lost for good.

Google Map Maker was first introduced back in 2008, and has been a mainstay of the software for the past nine years.

It is believed it’s been killed off over concerns surrounding the moderation process.

Google, however, still wants user contributions to its mapping software, just in a new guise.

That will be the responsibility of the new Local Guides program.

Writing on a new support page, Google has stated: “Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience.

“To make it easier for all Google Maps users to contribute changes to the map, we’ve started to graduate functionality from Map Maker to Google Maps on both desktop and mobile.

“We’ll continue to add new editing features within Google Maps on an ongoing basis.

“To keep contributing your local knowledge to Google Maps and engage with a passionate community of likeminded individuals, we invite you to join the Local Guides program.”

Earlier this month Google celebrated April Fool’s Day be letting users transform their mobile Google Maps app into a real world, playable game of Ms Pac-Man.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/603670/How-to-see-who-s-viewed-your-Facebook-profile","You can now see exactly who’s been looking at your Facebook profile - here’s how","Ever wanted to know who’s been looking at your Facebook profile?

Of course you have, we all have, it’s what every one of the social network’s more than 1.2 billion active daily users are all desperate to know.

Well, there’s now a way to discover exactly that.

The feature has been added as part of the latest Facebook update which has introduced then Facebook Stories tool.

Facebook Stories echoes a similar feature already available on rival services including Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram.

It lets users save videos and images to a daily ‘story’ that is then visible to all of our online friends.

There’s a key difference between this and past Facebook features, however.

While Facebook has always prevented you from seeing which of your friends have been scrolling through your photos, reading your posts and generally stalking your profile, Facebook Stories logs who has been looking.

Removing a layer of anonymity to your online actions, Facebook Stories will, like their Instagram-hosted counterparts, show users who has viewed their content.

Taking things a layer deeper, the new tool will show you exactly which individual images and videos have been viewed by which friends.

Although Facebook will let you see who has viewed your Stories, the company has said this is where it will draw the line.

Those snooping on your main profiles will continue to remain anonymous.

“Facebook doesn’t let people track who views their profile,” the social network states on its help centre website.

“Third-party apps also can’t provide this functionality. If you come across an app that claims to offer this ability, please report the app.”

This is the latest in a recent flurry of Facebook updates.

The world’s biggest social network recently launched its own Siri and Amazon Alexa rival, Facebook M, although the digital assistant was only available to those users based in the US.

Elsewhere, the company has added a mass of new stickers, graphics and animations to its Messenger application, turning the app into a true Snapchat challenger.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/603351/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-problems-fingerprint-scanner-camera-smudge-issues","Samsung Galaxy S8 has a major problem that Samsung is fully aware of but can't stop","Following last year’s exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, the last thing Samsung needed with its latest flagship phone was a serious problem.

Unfortunately, that’s exactly what the Korean manufacturer is facing.

Ahead of the in-store Samsung Galaxy S8 release date, it’s emerged that there’s an issue with the phone affecting both its inbuilt fingerprint scanner and camera.

Perhaps more worrying than the problem itself, however, is that it appears that Samsung was fully aware of the issue prior to the phone’s launch but can’t stop it.

Fortunately this isn’t an issue that will hamper the phone’s overall performance.

It is, however, one that’s likely to annoy more than a few users.

That’s because the problem affects the location of the phone’s inbuilt fingerprint scanner, and how its positioning is resulting in blurred, sub-par photos.

With the S8, Samsung has ditched the phone’s physical home button in order to squeeze a larger, near edge-to-edge display in a device barely any bigger than its predecessor.

With the home button having previously hosted the phone’s inbuilt biometric sensor, Samsung has been forced to relocate the fingerprint scanner, positioning it on the rear of the device.

Instead of placing this, like many Android phones, centrally and out of the way beneath the phone’s snapper, however, Samsung opted to squeeze it in right next to the phone’s camera lens.

With the scanner located so close to the camera, it’s been suggested that the phone’s picture tool has a tendency to become overrun with image-depleting grubby fingerprints.

Samsung seems to be aware that this is more of a problem than a mere nuisance too, with the company having installed pop-up warnings when using the camera.

According to those with early access to the phone, launching the camera app regularly sees the S8 warn of the potential for image-hampering fingerprints.

“A clean lens makes for better shots. Clean your camera lens to keep taking better pictures,” the pop-up reportedly states.

This would be the first time such warning messages have been included on Samsung’s flagship phone.

Disappointingly, this isn’t the first time the S8 has been hit by issues.

Despite having yet to be handed a consumer release, the phone’s facial recognition software has already been called into question.

Following the phone’s formal unveiled last week, a video emerged showing the face tracking unlock tool being fooled by a photograph of a user.

Such a security lapse could allow anyone to gain unwanted access to your device and all of the private information stored on it.

Despite the early issues, the Galaxy S8 is shaping up as one of the best phones of all time.

Set to hit retailers’ shelves on April 29, the phone features a stunning 5.8-inch curved screen that’s fitted within a beautiful, glass backed body.

The impressive visuals are paired with a 12-megapixel camera, new octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM.

The phone will cost a hefty £689 at launch, with pre-orders currently open.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/603608/iPhone-8-release-date-features-design-unbreakable-smartphone","iPhone 8 Release Date - This feature could solve the biggest problem with smartphones","We’ve all been there, a quick fumble, a simple mistake, and bang, 9 months of panic before something new comes along.

We’re talking, of course, about dropping a smartphone well before your 24 month contract is due for renewal.

It’s an issue many of us have had to live with, with shattered smartphone screens a common sight on trains and busses across the land.

Apple could have a solution to this common problem, however, having patented an iPhone design that would stop screens smashing if dropped.

Without compromising on the iPhone’s sleek lines and stunning good looks, the patent shows how future devices could feature corners designed to pop off on impact.

The unique, spring-loaded bumper case would see the phone’s corner elements pop off if dropped.

As the phone takes a tumble, the case system would deploy, much like a car’s airbag to prevent damage.

It’s not just drops to concrete that the future iPhones will be protected against either.

The patent has also shown how you could soon avoid losing your phone to the murky depths if dropping the device in deep water.

“The shock absorbers may include buoyant materials which permits the portable electronic device to float in the event that it is dropped or otherwise exposed to water environment,” the patent explains.

Originally filled with the US Patent and Trademark Office back in May 2014, the patent was reportedly awarded to Apple earlier this week on April 4.

Just because the tech has been patented, however, doesn’t guarantee it will actually be used on future phones.

Even if Apple does utilise this impact-absorbing tech in the future, don’t expect to see it on an iPhone anytime soon.

It’s highly unlikely that any such advancement will be fitted on the iPhone 8 expected to hit retailers later this year.

Instead, the iPhone 8 is expected to adopt a new glass-based, curved edge design and adopt a mass of new high-end innards.

According to recent reports, this will include a new A11 processor and Apple’s next-generation iOS 11 operating system.

Although Apple has yet to offer any formal comment on the claims, it has been suggested the iPhone 8 release date will be held this September with the phone reportedly set to drop alongside the Apple Watch 3.","geeky"

From Apple’s iPhone and iPad filling Siri to the Amazon Echo powering Alexa, digital assistants are everywhere.

Adding to that list, Facebook is now getting in on the act.

The social networking giant has launched its own digital assistant, dubbed ‘M’ to help users of its Facebook Messenger platform discover new features and abilities.

Instead of being a voice controlled assistant like some of its rivals, M is a pop-up assistant that suggests “helpful actions” within your chat windows.

“M is your automated assistant in Messenger that offers suggests during your conversations,” Facebook explained.

The Twitter and Snapchat rival added: “M offers suggestions by popping into an open conversation to suggest relevant content and capabilities to enrich the way people communicate and get things done.”

These suggestions include sending your location to friends, ordering a taxi or setting up a calendar alert directly within the app.

M will also encourage you to send stickers, start a poll and even send money to friends without ever leaving Messenger.

Facebook

Having been tested on a small group of users for a number months, Facebook is now introducing M to the masses.

There is a catch, however, M is currently only available to users in the US.

There’s is currently no word on when UK Messenger users will be offered the feature.

“When we announced M over a year ago, it was a small AI experiment powered by humans that could fulfil almost any request,” Facebook’s Messenger Product Managers Laurent Landowski and Kemal El Moujahid said in an official blog post.

“We learned a lot and these interactions have enabled us to build a completely automated version of M that suggests helpful actions in your chat, exposing features people may not have known were available right in Messenger.

“Suggestions from M has been testing with a small percentage of users for the past few months — and it has been a great success — today we’re expanding it to all Messenger users in the US.”

Although us Brits aren’t getting Facebook M just yet, that doesn’t mean we’re not being treated to any new Facebook features.

The social giant has confirmed first Messenger updates are UK-bound.

“Messenger users across the globe will also start to see a redesigned way to compose messages,” Landowski and Moujahid confirmed.

“This update offers an easier way to access and discover Messenger features like our rich visual messaging tools and the ability to quickly share content like video and images directly from the text composer with a long press.

“We’re also adding a “More” tab to more easily access Messenger features such as Games, Payments, Share Location and Rides.”

It’s worrying then that Pornhub has just been ordered to hand over the personal details of some users.

The order, handed down by a federal court in California, has demanded the names, email address, IP addresses and other identifying information of certain users.

Unless you’ve been up to no good online, however, your information should be safe from exposure.

That’s because the court order only covers users who have been found to have uploaded pirated videos.

The court approved the request for a DMCA subpoena which was filed by the Seychelles-based adult company, Foshan Ltd.

The company, known for the adult film brand “Wankz”, sought the ruling in a bid to discover who was responsible for uploading more than 1,000 illegal copies of its videos.

As Pornhub allows users to upload their own videos, this is far from the first time the company has faced copyright infringement claims.

“We take claims of copyrighting infringement seriously,” an official Pornhub spokesperson has said, adding that infringements to these rules will be severely punished.

“Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user’s access to PornHub, or all of the foregoing.”

Unless Pornhub decides to appeal, the world’s most popular adult website has until May 1 to hand over the requested information.

The information requested is quite wide-arching too, will everything the company holds on its users up for grabs.

This includes name, email address, IP address, physical address, telephone number.

Perhaps most worryingly, however, it also includes posting and user history, yep, the smutty videos that users’ have watched.

It is believed this is the first time a rights holder as been issued a DMCA subpoena to discover information about Pornhub users.

It’s not just illegal copies of adult videos that have found their way up on to the porn site.

Last month it emerged that the adult-only website was being used to host Hollywood movies that could then be illegally streamed for free.

Uploaders were reportedly making use of Pornhub’s platform as it’s copyright checks on uploaded content were more relaxed than those of general purpose video hosting sites such as YouTube.","geeky"

Apple has just released its all-new Clips app which makes creating a mini movie masterpiece a total breeze.

Clips is available now on Apple's App Store and is aimed at bringing some daily fun to your messages and Facebook posts.

The simple app automatically edits together live or pre-recorded videos, photos and voice clips with easy controls allowing the videos to be produced and shared in seconds.

Clips makes things incredibly simple with one-touch controls powering the app.

However, there are some more advanced features on offer for those wanting to add some extra excitement to their movies.

Photos can be animated by simply pinching and dragging them while recording and videos can be edited within the app so you get the perfect shots.

There's also the ability to add some music to your clips and Apple's clever software will even automatically fade the song at the end of the video.

Clips also introduces Live Titles, a breakthrough feature that lets users create animated captions and titles using just the power of their voice.

Users simply speak into their iPhone or iPad's microphone with the words then appearing like magic in the clip.

There's seven styles to choose from and these captions can even be edited by a simple tap on the screen allowing punctuation and extra words to be added or removed.

Along with captions, users of Clips can also place emojis, speech bubbles, arrows and banners into their creation with all videos instantly saved within the Clips app.

Once the video is ready it can easily be shared via the Messages app, or on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social networks.

Apple is keen to point out that Clips doesn't replace its popular iMovie software but instead makes creating short videos faster and easier for everyone.

Clips is available now for free and is compatible with iPhone 5s and later, the new 9.7-inch iPad, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad mini 2 and later, and iPod touch 6th generation. Devices must be running iOS 10.3.

Speaking about the new app, Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Apps Product Marketing, said: “Clips gives iPhone and iPad users a new way to express themselves through video, and it’s incredibly easy to use,

“The effects, filters and amazing new Live Titles we’ve designed for Clips let anyone make great-looking, easily sharable videos with just a few taps.”

The news of this new launch comes as Apple's latest iOS update has been pushed out.

Apple released iOS 10.3 to iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch owners worldwide last week.

The new iOS update includes a slew of user-facing features – as well one major behind-the-scenes change.

One of the biggest new features in iOS 10.3 is the addition of a Find My AirPods mode within the in the Find My iPhone app.

This allows users to track the location of their wireless earbuds by checking the last location where the AirPods were connected to an iOS device over Bluetooth.

When she was just 18, she packed up her car and drove 1,500 miles from Iowa to Florida, where she stumbled across the burlesque scene and decided to unleash her own inner diva.

Her transition and subsequent plastic surgery cost over $250,000, and Ms Cass has had almost every cosmetic procedure possible, including numerous breast augmentation surgeries and bum implants.

Now a successful Hollywood performer and actress, she is encouraging other people to stand up to discrimination and follow their dreams.

Ms Cass said: ""I have always known that I should be Cassandra - there is no question about that.

""I've been to hell and back but now I'm finally the fabulous woman I was born to be and I hope that now my story can inspire others.""

Ms Cass says she knew she was a female from a very young age, and as a little boy she would long to play with dolls and dress up.

When she was a young child her mother left the family, leaving her with her ultra-masculine basketball coach father and three older brothers.

Her feminine behaviour was not tolerated, and when she was 16 her family disowned her after she came out to her father.

She said: ""I was hyper feminine as a little boy. I mean it was just a no-brainer. People would say to my parents like, 'Oh, you have a beautiful daughter'.

""So I told my dad. I said, 'Dad I really feel like I want to be a woman, this is who I am'.

""My dad was reading and he lowered his paper and he looked up at me and he said, 'Who is going to want you? Why would anybody want to be with something like that? And you are going to be the ugliest woman' and it devastated me.

""It devastated me but it also made me angry and I set off on a journey where I was going to prove him wrong.""

Ms Cass was put into care, and two years later she set off for Orlando to live as Cassandra permanently.

And she went to great lengths to become the woman she had always envisioned.

Ms Cass, 33, said: ""The woman who sits before you now has spent over $250,000 on her transition. We are talking many, many surgeries.

""The only thing I haven't had done is my heart.

""I have had my nose, my cheeks, my lips, my teeth, my jaw, my Adam's apple, my boobs, my hips and my booty done, and I now have an 'inny' instead of an 'outy' or to make it more blunt - I have a vajayjay.

""I wanted to be pretty. For me I didn't want to be an ugly woman. I didn't want to be a basic, simple woman.

""I wanted to be type of girl who would walk in to room and people would notice.""

Although her transformation into a beautiful woman has boosted her self-esteem, she acknowledges that she has experienced negativity from others.

She said: ""I think the hardest thing for me has been getting people just to accept me as me.

""When I say I am transgender, nine times out of ten it is not a positive reaction, but I don't really believe in labels anyway.

""I believe labels are for products not for people and I don't believe putting people in categories is healthy.

""People really have a lack of respect for people such as myself and think that it is okay to verbally or even physically abuse us or kill us, and the only thing I can say is, 'Honey if you come for me, you better be prepared because I am not a pushover'.""

Ms Cass now lives in Hollywood and is making a name for herself as an actress - appearing on shows such as CSI.

And her burlesque shows are a major hit on Hollywood Boulevard.

Ms Cass said: ""I love the fantasy of burlesque. I can be anything I want to be. I can be a blonde, I can be a brunette, I can be Jessica Rabbit.

""You are on a stage and there is a level of glamour and an untouchability about it and it makes me happy.""","boorish"

Highs of 24C are expected today and weathermen hope to see above average temperatures up to the end of June.

Highs could verge on 30C. June has seen recordings of 27C to 31C in each of the past five years, Met Office records show.

The bombshell move would see Brits forced to apply for permission to visit Europe before they can do any travelling.

They will then have to pay a €14 (£10) fee for applying, and would preferably need to do so 72 hours before leaving.

The programme, called the EU Travel Information and Authorisation System (Etias) is being drawn up by the European Commission.

It comes in the wake of the terror attacks in France and Belgium, and most recently the hit in Stockholm, Sweden.

Getty

The scheme would cover all visitors to the 26-nation Schengen zone from countries that do not need a visa to enter.

Although Britain is not part of this zone, UK nationals are able to show a valid passport to enter and then travel freely within it.

But once the country leaves the EU, citizens will have to apply through the ESTA-like scheme.

The only way Britain can avoid this is during the Brexit negotiations over the next two years.

Getty

But when Daily Star Online contacted the Department for Brexit, a spokesperson refused to confirm if efforts will be made to make the UK exempt from the system.

The spokesperson told us: ""We're determined to get the best possible deal for the UK and are preparing for a smooth and orderly exit from the EU.

""We are aware that the EU is discussing the possibility of introducing a system of travel authorisation (ETIAS). This is one of many areas that may need to be addressed as we leave the EU and agree a new partnership.""

The comments come a week after ABTA, which represents travel agents across the country, warned that Brits could face sky-rocketing prices on holidays.

Speaking to Daily Star Online about the European Parliament’s visa plans, Daily Parker, a spokesperson for the travel experts, confirmed: “The EU is proposing to introduce a European Travel Information Authorisation System (ETIAS), similar to the US ESTA system, which obliges all travellers to register in advance and pay a fee to enter the EU.

""This proposal is currently being ratified in Brussels and is expected to come in in 2020/21 once the UK has left the EU.""

Getty

She added: “ABTA believes the Government should seek an exemption for British travellers. Otherwise ETIAS would incur costs for British travellers, as well as being a barrier to travel.

“UK residents made 37 million holiday and business trips to the EU in 2015, and holidaymakers and business travellers take for granted the ease of travelling to Europe. Ensuring that this can continue by securing visa-free travel for holidays and short business trips should be the goal of the Government.”

Getty

But the 16-year-old from North Carolina, US, played him at his game by layering up in more and more towels.

The banter started when the eager beaver asked Jacquie to ""show off her outfit"" and she replied: ""I am not fit for being seen right now believe me"", along with a selfie in a green face mask.

Michael – who wouldn't take no for an answer – went on to ask ""what's below the picture"" and in response, Jacquie sent a picture of herself in a towel.

When asked: ""What's under the towel?"" Jacquie stripped off to reveal ""another towel"".

Persistent Michael then asked: ""What's under that? I'm gonna get what I want.""

But unfortunately for Michael, Jacquie revealed yet another towel – which is when he accused her of ""putting on more towels"", she replied: ""False. I always put on exactly 18 towels after a shower.""

When he continued to hassle her, Jacquie ended up putting her robe back on – and starting the whole circus again by stripping off to reveal yet another towel.

To amuse the bloke, Jacquie's towels were all different colours – leaving us to wonder if she really does put on 18 different towels after a shower.

Jacquie posted screenshots of the text on Tumblr – where they have gone viral with more than 63,000 notes.

Speaking to BuzzFeed News, she said: ""I think its funny how everyone's creeped out by 'I'm gonna get what I want'.

""I also like when people are like 'I'm gonna use this for future reference!'""

Speaking of the relationship with Michael, she added: ""He's sort of a friend so we talk pretty often.

Some 87 people — including 27 children — were killed in last week’s chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun.

Harrowing pictures showed innocent civilians choking to death in the suspected sarin nerve gas strike.

In response, Donald Trump rained down 59 Tomahawk missiles from a US ship in the Mediterranean to blast the Syrian airbase where the chemical attack was launched.

Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir Michael reiterated his support for the US's action against Assad’s brutal regime.

He wrote: ""By sending Tomahawk missiles to attack the airfield, aeroplanes and equipment believed to be involved, it has sent a strong signal to the Syrian regime to think twice before using gas in the future.”

The Defence Secretary said Russia must play its part in ending the “needless suffering” of Syrian civilians.

He wrote: “But Assad's principal backer is Russia. By proxy Russia is responsible for every civilian death last week.

""If Russia wants to be absolved of responsibility for future attacks, Vladimir Putin needs to enforce commitments, to dismantle Assad's chemical weapons arsenal for good, and to get fully engaged with the UN peacekeeping progress.""

Sir Michael's comments came after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson pulled out of a Moscow visit hours before he was due to fly.

He said the UK continues to “deplore” Moscow’s defence of Assad’s bombing.

Moscow hit back at Britain, saying his decision to pull out of the meeting shows a lack of understanding of events in Syria.

The Russian ministry said the decision to cancel the visit showed once more that there was little to gain from talking to Britain, which it said had no real influence over world affairs.

Iran and Russia — Assad’s key allies — condemned Trump’s strikes as war fears continue to build.

Russia’s Prime Minister said the US came “less than an inch” from sparking a military clash with Putin’s army

He said the strike destroyed relations between the two superpowers as a Russian fleet was sent to the Mediterranean in retaliation.

Mr Johnson's decision has been criticised by Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, who branded him “Washington’s poodle”.

He said: “Is this what taking back control looks like? Our government quick to blindly follow every order from the Trump White House.”

Mr Johnson is due to lead demands for Russia to withdraw its forces from Syria when he meets with G7 leaders in Italy next week.","dramatic"

It was among several other balloons which also took to the skies for a scenic tour, according to the country's state-run media.

But it is the third crash at the historic site, in Central Anatolia, in as many months.

A Danish tourist died in February when a hot air balloon made a ""hard landing"" nearby.

And one month later in March, 49 people were hurt when three balloons were forced to make an emergency landing while battling strong winds.

Emergency services rushed the passengers to hospital where they are currently receiving treatment.

None of the 20 said to be hurt are thought to have suffered life threateneing injuries, officials said.

The tourist who died is believed to be French, it has been claimed.

Cappadocia is a popular tourist destination known for its volcanic rock-formations, underground cities and churches carved into mountainsides.

The serial killer attempted to justify his heinous crimes to his wife, Sonia, by claiming voices in his head told him to kill prostitutes.

In a taped confession obtained by the Sunday Mirror, he said: ""She had no idea, not a clue. I never had any blood on me or anything.

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has previously promised to reduce the US ""to ashes"" and is believed to possess an ICBM which could devastate US heartland.

After being advised to assassinate the tubby tyrant, Trump's first act has been to deploy a navy strike group, consisting of the USS Carl Vinson, to the peninsula.

This is the same unit that participated in attack drills on North Korea.

According to a statement read out on his propaganda news agency, the KCNA: ""Some forces are loud-mouthed that the recent US military attack on Syria is on action of warning us but we are not afraid of it.""

Kim previously hit out at the strikes as an ""undisguised act of aggression"".

He also insisted that they showed North Korea's need for an even bigger nuclear arsenal as a war deterrent.

The agency added: ""What happened in Syria once again taught a bitter lesson that we can defend ourselves from imperialist aggression only when we have strength.

Soham murderer Ian Huntley and Milly Dowler killer Levi Bellfield were among the first prisoners to be offered the treatment at HMP Frankland.

But both of the vile killers have turned down a place on the scheme.

Programme creator professor Don Grubin told the Sunday People: ""Their level of sexual arousal is so high they find it difficult to engage in psychological treatment programmes.

“In others their level of arousal may be the cause of them getting themselves in trouble in the ­prison.”

Unlike surgical castration, chemical castration does not remove any organs.

The top answer? They want men to make more noise.

“We need you to make noise too so we can know what you like. Moan or talk, don’t care. Give us some direction!” This comment garnered 8,325 points.

Other comments that were liked in their thousands were, “DO NOT IMMEDIATELY JACKHAMMER THE PUSSY”, and “It’s like summoning a genie, not stuffing a chicken.”

Over 7,800 women also seemed to dislike fingering, “Your fingers make a terrible substitute for a dick,” one commenter wrote. “Do not use them like one. Use them to massage, not to ram in and out of us.”

One woman also pointed out one of the more, erm, awkward moments when it comes to intercourse.

“Sometimes toilet paper can get up in there and we won’t realise. Sorry about that.”

Another women pointed out that, in fact, every woman is different and some things that worked on your ex won’t work for every woman.

“The shit that worked on your ex will not work on all women!” she exclaimed. “I had a guy who wouldn't stop awkwardly fingering the backs of my knees.

“Sure, some women love that, but PAY ATTENTION TO OUR REACTIONS. If you don't, I'll eventually just tell you that I don't like it, but that kills the mood a little.”

The women of Reddit also want fellas to focus a little more on foreplay – and not going straight to the clitoris. They want you to “stroke the body, kiss and massage the breasts.”

But revellers across the globe have more wild and wonderful ideas about spending the summer months at some of the most bizarre festivals on Earth.

And it turns out many of them involve worshipping genitalia, group sex and wearing little if any clothing.

Electric Daisy Carnival– Las Vegas, US

One of the biggest dance music festivals in the world, the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) sees thousands flock to Las Vegas, Nevada, each year.

The festival has been dubbed the Ibiza of America and just like its Mediterranean counterpart, the clubbers that go to party are toned, tanned and rarely fully dressed.

There is actually a strict no nudity rule, but that doesn’t mean hot young guys and girls don’t push the rules to the limit in colourful underwear sets.

Kanamara Fertility Festival – Japan

This bizarre celebration sees young women riding wooden penis statues through the streets.

The festival was originally a small celebration in a village in Japan that included a parade to bring marital bliss, fertility and good luck to young families.

But it has now grown into a much larger event that sees festival fans come from far and wide to see a giant steel phallus get carried through the crowds and enjoy penis shaped treats.

Beltane Fire Festival – Scotland

The Beltane Fire Festival is an annual ancient Celtic arts and ritual drama event held in Edinburgh at the end of April.

The celebration is aimed at celebrating the birth of Summer and the fertility of the land.

But revellers also celebrate their own fertility by worshipping a sacred fire and engaging in wild courtship rituals – including orgies.

One former Beltane attendee wrote online: “Sex among Pagans is a Beltane tradition.

“It isn’t sex for the sake of having sex. Sex at Beltane is an act of devotion.”

Baby Jumping Festival – Spain

Among the less erotic and more just downright bizarre is the Spanish holiday El Colacho – or baby jumping.

The tradition dates back to 1620 and sees men dressed as the Devil in red and yellow jump suits jump over babies born during the previous year.

The babies are lined up on mattresses in the street while the ""Devils"" hold whips and oversized castanets as they jump over the unaware infants.

It is said to cleanse the babies of the original sin, ensure them safe passage through life and guard against illness and evil spirits.

Testy Fest – Montana, US

The Montana Testicle Festival sees men and women partying, enjoying wet t-shirt contests and eating testicles.

Female revellers “earn beads” by flashing their boobs and men are encouraged to compare their privates.

It’s a celebration that attracts thousands yearly for some good clean testicle-based fun.

Louisiana Mud Fest – Louisiana, US

Known as “one of the wildest parties in the South”, the Mud Fest sees bikini babes wrestling semi-naked in the mud and dancing on massive trucks.

Truckers race through rivers of mud and although families do attend – the majority of people admit it's all about the booze and babes.

Visitors who have gone to the epic celebration of giant cars say it's the wildest event of its kind.

One described it as a ""beer drinking extravaganza"".","dubious"

With the device having already been caught on camera, an iPhone 8 case has now popped up online.

Instead of doing the rounds on its own, however, the iPhone 8 accessory has been snapped alongside both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, showing how the upcoming handset will line up compared to Apple’s existing smartphones.

According to the leak, the eagerly awaited iPhone 8 will be bigger than the existing 4.7-inch iPhone 7, yet smaller than the 5.5-inch 7 Plus.

Past reports have suggested that the iPhone 8 will line up at 144mm tall by 71mm wide and 7.7mm thick.

By contrast, the iPhone 7 currently lines up at 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm while the 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm.

That’s just overall dimensions, however.

Given that the phone is widely expected to ditch its front-mounted physical home button in order to integrate a near edge-to-edge display, the new iPhone’s dimensions might not tell the whole story.

While the iPhone 8 will seemly adopt a larger screen in a device with a smaller overall footprint, it will be noticeably fatter than Apple’s current handsets.

The plumper form will seemingly be as a result of heavily upgraded internals.

It’s been claimed that the iPhone 8 will play host to a new, more powerful A11 processor and a larger battery.

This will reportedly be paired with a new, vertically aligned dual lens camera and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor hidden directly beneath the phone’s new OLED display.

Cut outs on the newly leaked iPhone 8 case have seemingly backed up these reports, with the elongated camera hole present while there’s on rear-mounted Touch ID gap.

Although not shown in the latest tease, past leaks have shown that the iPhone 8 will benefit from a new metal-edged, glass-backed design.

This ditching of an aluminium rear will reportedly allow Apple to finally fit its phone with wireless charging capabilities.

Despite Apple remaining tight lipped on the matter, it’s been heavily reported that the iPhone 8 will be unveiled this September.

The phone won’t be alone either.

The star of the show will also reportedly be joined on the launch stage by lower key iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus unveilings, as well as the circular Apple Watch 3.","geeky"

While Apple continues to remain tight lipped on the matter, prolific iPhone tipster Benjamin Geskin has teased the potential launch plans on Twitter.

According to Geskin, with the iPhone 8 will be formally announced on September 17 alongside the more low key iPhone 7S.

This big reveal will reportedly be follow by an in-store release on September 25.

Taking the Twitter, the tipster wrote: “Apple’s iPhone 8/7s Keynote will be held on September 17. Sales September 25.”

Despite teasing the dates, Geskin has noted that the timeframe is still not 100% confirmed.

Although the well credited tipster has risked his reputation with the claim, we’d suggest taking the prediction with a sizeable pinch of salt for now.

That’s because justified questions are already being raised about the validity of the claims.

While the mid-September timeframe would fit with the past five years of iPhone unveilings, the September 17 date tipped appears unlikely.

That’s because the 17th falls on a Sunday.

Ever since 2012, Apple has unveiled its latest flagship phones on either a Tuesday or Wednesday in early September.

This has been followed less than two weeks later by an in-store release on the Friday of the following week.

Again raising questions, Gaskin’s mooted September 25 launch would see the iPhone 8 made available to consumers on a Monday, breaking with Apple’s rigid tradition.

Based purely on Apple’s history then, what’s more likely is a September 6 or 13 unveiling followed by a release on either September 15 or 22. This, however, is pure speculation.

While the iPhone 8 release date might still be shrouded in mystery, the phone’s specs sheet has already been the subject of multiple leaks and early outings.

According to multiple teases, the iPhone 8 will play host to a new A11 processor which will line up alongside the iOS 11 software expected to be unveiled during next month’s WWDC conference.

This combination of power and precision will reportedly be backed up by a new OLED display and a vertically aligned dual lens camera.

The phone is also widely expected to adopt a new design, with metal making way for a new glass rear and a face that trades in a physical home button for a larger, more immersive display.","geeky"

With a number of content rights holders looking to stem the flow of illegal so-called fully loaded Kodi boxes, the online social giant has implemented new measures to slow sales of such set-top box.

Introducing a blanket ban, Facebook as ceased sales of all hardware running Kodi software from its online store.

Although Kodi itself is a perfectly legal software service, some users with nefarious intentions have abused its support of content plug-ins.

These plug-ins, which give free access to pay-protected content, have been pre-loaded onto set-top boxes with Kodi software.

Kodi, however, does not make any hardware in its own right.

Instead, third-party vendors have abused the software, installing it on a range of generic devices.

As well as letting users access torrent sites from their TV, these fully loaded boxes offer illegal access to a range of copyright protected content, ranging from Hollywood movies to live sporting events.

As part of its crackdown, Facebook has made significant changes to its commerce policy, limiting what users can buy and sell through its social marketplace.

Part of these changes has seen a block on the sale of “Products or items that facilitate or encourage unauthorised access to digital media.”

Although covering a number of devices, the biggest victim of the new rule changes are units powered by Kodi software.

Facebook isn’t the first high-profile seller to implements such a block either.

The social behemoth follows the likes of Amazon and eBay in scrapping sales of the set-top boxes that are geared towards illegal streaming.

The collection of key online retailers have all made the decision to aid in the prevention of copyright infringement.

While Facebook isn’t planning on taking legal action against those who have used its platform to sell so-called Kodi boxes, its sales ban has been introduced with immediate effect.

User accounts who have listed Kodi-powered hardware for sale, however, could face a ban.

Earlier this year the Premier League took a hard legal stance against those using illegal Kodi boxes to view copyright protected matches.

“The Premier League is currently engaged in its largest ever anti-piracy campaign to protect its copyright,” a spokesman for the league said recently.

They added: “Like other sports and creative industries our model is predicated on the ability to market and sell rights and protect our intellectual property.

“It is because of this that clubs can invest in and develop talented players, build world-class stadium, support the English football pyramid and schools and communities across the country - all things that fans enjoy and wider society benefits from.”","geeky"

Well now that future has taken a significant step closer to the realms of reality.

While flying cars are still an impractical pipe dream and voice-controlled AI continues to improve albeit slowly thanks to the likes of Siri and Alexa, robots have just taken over a major new job role.

Over in Dubai, the world’s first robotic policemen have been handed their badges and put on duty.

Designed by Spanish firm PAL Robotics, the mechanical coppers stands 5 feet 6 inches tall and roll around on a set of integrated wheels.

Before you start getting RoboCop inspired nightmares where you’re being chased around by a rogue droid, however, worry not.

The robotic police office is currently more of a aid for reporting crimes rather than and out-and-out crimefighter in its own right.

To this extent, it features a touchscreen display located within its chest, letting members of the public get information and report crimes without having to deal with flesh and blood pencil pushers.

This initial, somewhat underwhelming introduction is just the first stage of Dubai’s robotic police plans, however.

“We are looking to make everything smart in Dubai Police,” General Director of Dubai Police’s Smart Services Department, Brigadier Khalid Nasserl Al Razouqi told Gulf News.

“By 2030, we will have the first smart police station which won’t require human employees.”

As well as a completely robot run station, Dubai hopes to replace a quarter of its police force with droid workers within the next 13 years.

This isn’t the first robot to have been introduced in place of human workers either.

Oakland airport has previously introduced robot assistants, while AI workers have also started popping up on reception desks of a number of Japanese hotels.

This is just the start too.

According to a report earlier this year, as many as 10 million UK workers could be at risk of losing their jobs to robot replacements within the next 15 years.","geeky"

Despite playing host to a stunning design and a flagship array of specs, the £399 OnePlus 3T lines up a full £200 cheaper than the base level iPhone 7.

This wallet-friendly price tag also makes it almost £300 more adorable than the Samsung Galaxy S8 and half the price of the larger Samsung Galaxy S8+.

Although kind to users’ bank balances, the OnePlus 3T doesn’t cut any corners.

The sleek, 7.4mm slim metal backed handset plays host to a sizeable 5.5-inch display with a bright, 1920 x 1080p Full HD resolution.

This is backed up by a powerful quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, a massive 6GB of RAM and the option of 64GB or 128GB of internal storage.

Powered by Google’s latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS - software that’s still missing from many high-end Android handsets - the OnePlus 3T also packs a sizeable 3400mAh battery that will see you cruise through a full day’s use on a single charge.

It’s impressive specs sheet is rounded off by a 16-megapixel rear-mounted primary camera and another 16-meg snapper up front for selfie fans.

Despite the phone’s imminent demise, OnePlus has confirmed that those snapping up the final few handsets will continue to be supported by regular software updates.

Describe the outgoing 3T as “far and away our most successful device yet,” OnePlus’s Steve G stated: “A lot has happened since we launched the OnePlus 3T back in November.

“Since merging our software platforms, we’ve been able to push out more consistent software updates simultaneously for the OnePlus 3 and 3T.

“Rest assured that we’ll continue to bring more software updates and support to the OnePlus 3 and 3T.”

Despite the OnePlus 3T being removed from sale next week, the replacement OnePlus 5 is still some way from launch.

So far, the independent manufacturer has confirmed only that the phone will be unveiled ‘this summer’.

Specs and features bound for the upcoming device are still shrouded in mystery.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/617560/Samsung-Gear-S4-release-date-leaks-features-camera-strap","These leaked Samsung Gear S4 features would make it the ultimate Apple Watch rival","The Samsung Gear S3 is arguably the Apple Watch’s closest smartwatch rival, and it’s about to get even better.

The upcoming Samsung Gear S4 has leaked, with the wearable tipped to play host to a number of futuristic new features that could give it the wearable edge.

According to newly surfaced patents, Samsung is working on a next-gen wearable that plays host to an integrated camera with an optical zoom.

This is just the tip of the device’s feature rich iceberg too, with a second patent showing off a space age digital watch strap that could add a second screen to user’s wrists.

Both features feel positively forward thinking by current smartwatch standards, and if formally introduced, would give the Gear S4 a major advantage over the competition.

The patent filings, leaked by Russian news outlet 3D News, were originally registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office back in November 2016.

The camera leak shows a watch with a camera lens protruding from the centre of the device’s screen.

While this would obviously hamper the wearable’s visual efforts, acting as a central point around which all on-screen content would need to be based, the positioning would allow for an optical zoom to be introduced.

Despite letting users take up close and personal selfies without losing image quality, its inclusion would still likely be a contentious one.

What would be more likely to appeal to the masses, however, is Samsung’s plans to adopt screen-enhanced smart straps.

A feature Apple is also known to be looking at, such an inclusion would utilise flexible screen technology and allow users to access specific apps and contact details simply by tapping elements of the strap.

This would leave the watch’s compact circular screen free and unobstructed to display key information and real-time data.

Although the patents have shown what Samsung is working on, there’s no guarantee they will be introduced to devices either this year, or at any point in the future.

The Samsung Gear S4 is likely to come too soon for such advanced additions, with the next-generation wearable tipped to drop in September.

A device that will likely be introduced at the Berlin-based tech show IFA, the likely Tizen-powered Gear S4 could well face stiffer competition than ever.

It is believed the Apple Watch 3 will be unveiled the same month, with the iPhone maker’s third-generation wearable tipped to finally adopt a circular screen.

Despite being the world’s most popular smartwatch, the Apple Watch has still faced criticism from some for still boasting a square panel.","geeky"

Now, a claimed iPhone 8 dummy unit has made a premature appearance, reportedly showing off what the next-generation handset will look like.

A device that’s already been the subject of multiple leaks, the latest iPhone 8 tease follows past reports that the phone will adopt a radical new form.

Shown without Apple’s trademark physical home button, the iPhone 8 unit has been caught on video with a new, vertically aligned dual camera also on display.

The leak has come courtesy of repeated Apple tipster Benjamin Geskin, with the phone teased by a video posted to Twitter.

As well as the handset’s missing physical home button and double-downed camera, the iPhone 8 video has shown a phone with a larger, near edge-to-edge display.

In an unusual move, however, the device actually looks significantly plumper than the existing iPhone 7, although exact dimensions have yet to be given.

The phone’s new look is finished with Apples trademark curved corners, with a metal frame surrounding a new glass rear.

The video is the latest in a recent flurry of iPhone 8 leaks and rumours.

It’s recently been claimed that the phone will adopt a new, visually superior OLED display while the missing home button means the device’s integrated Touch ID fingerprint will need to be relocated.

Exactly where the biometric security measure will pop up is still surrounded in mystery, however.

Although it was originally claimed the fingerprint sensor would move to the rear of the phone, the latest video shows this might not be the case.

Further reports have hinted Apple was hoping to hide the Touch ID sensor beneath the screen itself, although manufacturing difficulties could hamper these hopes.

Beyond a moved security sensor, the iPhone 8 has been mooted to play host to a mass of high-end features and components.

These will reportedly include a new A11 processor and enhanced cameras, while the WWDC 2017 bound iOS 11 software update will likely make its debut aboard the iPhone 8.

Although Apple has yet to comment on the claims, it’s widely expected that the iPhone 8 release date will be held this September.

Despite being the star of the show, the high-end handset won’t have the launch stage all to itself, however.

As well as two further phones, the more low key iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, it’s believed the eagerly awaited event will act as the launch platform for the Apple Watch 3, a device that could finally adopt a circular screen.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/617284/Facebook-video-platform-Netflix-rival-original-programming","Facebook could launch a major new feature that means you can stop paying for Netflix","Facebook is reportedly about to launch a new feature that could potentially save you a lot of money.

According to a number of recent leaks, the social networking giant is getting ready to reveal its own original video content service.

Now, citing “several sources familiar with the situation”, Reuters has claimed Facebook has signed up a number of content partners that will help it follow the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime into the realms of original programming.

It claims that Facebook has signed deals with a number of youth-focussed news and entertainment creators including Vox Media and BuzzFeed.

This isn’t where the list of new media partners ends either.

Group Nine Media and ATTN have also reportedly signed on the dotted line to create new, exclusive programming that will be visible on a new Facebook video platform.

These shows will fall into two categories, scripted shows that will run between 20 and 30 minutes per episode, and shorter, unscripted content that will take users between 5 and 10 minutes to watch.

While many of you favourite shows such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black won’t be available on the new platform, the launch could be enough to tempt some away from their Netflix accounts that cost between £5.99 and £8.99 per month depending on their bundle.

That’s because Facebook’s service will reportedly free to use.

Instead of charging monthly subscription fees, the social network will instead use pre and in-show advertising to generate revenues.

According to the new report, Facebook will pay up to $250,000 for episodes of longer, scripted shows that will rival original content from the likes of Netflix.

These will reportedly be completed by a range of shorter, second tier programming for which the social giant will fork out between $10,000 and $35,000.

This isn’t all content creators stand to earn though.

With Facebook set to annoy users by running ads through the middle of both short and long form content, those who create the content will be handed a share of ad revenue.

While this isn’t a new idea, YouTube already offers content creators a small cut of ad revenue, Facebook looks set to be more generous with its shares.

It’s been claimed that content creators will be given as much as 55% of ad revenues.

Although Facebook has yet to comment on the claims of the new content partners, the company has repeatedly expressed its desire to move into original video content.

Having confirmed late last year that it would buy in original programming, the Twitter rival also signed up former MTV executive Mina Lefevre to head up the new platform.

It’s currently unclear exactly when the new Facebook video platform will launch.","geeky"

Getting the excitement levels soaring early, the first Samsung Galaxy S9 details have started to pop up online.

According to latest reports Samsung is already well underway on S9 development, with the device’s codename also making a premature appearance.

It’s been suggested that the phone is doing the rounds internally under the moniker of the “Star”.

While the Samsung Galaxy S9 is already expected to be one of the phones of 2018, it reportedly won’t be alone on Sammy’s launch lineup.

The report out of Samsung’s native South Korea also suggests that the phone will be launched alongside a larger sibling.

Seemingly following this year’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ collection, the plus sized sibling is said to go by the name, internally at least, as the “Star 2”.

Despite revealing the company’s plans to launch a pair of new handsets, there’s currently no word on exactly what dimensions the new devices will adopt.

Currently, the existing Samsung Galaxy S8 boasts a sizeable 5.8-inch curved edged Infinity Display squeezed in to a footprint barely any bigger than last year’s 5.1-inch Galaxy S7.

By contrast, the Galaxy S8+ packs a massive 6.2-inch display in a similarly svelte body.

These impressive screen to body ratios have been achieved by removing the phone’s physical home button and stretching the display down to incorporate almost all of the device’s face.

It’s expected that the upcoming Galaxy S9 will adopt a similar screen-heavy form.

While the latest leaks have outed the Galaxy S9’s codename, firmed up specs and features are still to be confirmed.

This isn’t the first uttering of the S9 we’ve heard, however.

Past reports have suggested the next-generation iPhone rival will adopt a visually enhanced 4K display, a feature tipped to debut on the Galaxy Note 8 later this year.

The Samsung Galaxy S9 is not expected to be unveiled until late February 2018 at the earliest.

Put on sale last month, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is arguably the most impressive Android handset available right now.

As well as stunning screen and futuristic design, the phone plays host to a powerful octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM and a 12-megapixel primary camera that’s a specialist at low-light shooting.","geeky"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/617016/Nokia-3310-UK-release-date-price-faults-issues-SIM-card-size","Nokia 3310 UK sales begin but you need to know about this serious fault before buying one","The Nokia 3310 is an icon of recent decades and one of the most memorable gadgets of all time, and now the phone is back.

The pre-smartphone handset was officially revamped back in February with the basic pocket blower now finally available for purchase in the UK.

While the phone has added a number of impressive new features, however, the device isn’t without issue.

Despite a wallet-friendly price tag, the new Nokia 3310 plays host to a pretty serious fault.

Given the handset’s lack of modern smartphone smarts, it’s unlikely to replace many users’ existing iPhones and Samsung Galaxy handsets, it has, however, been tipped as a popular festival phone of choice.

Thanks to its affordability and ability to make and receive calls and texts as well as take photographs, it’s believed that many festival goers will splash out on a Nokia 3310 in order to keep in contact with mates while also keeping their high-end handsets safe from incessant rain, drunken drops and light-fingered music fans.

Those buying the 3310 as a secondary safety handset have a problem, though, and a big one at that.

Unlike most modern smartphones, the Nokia 3310 has shunned current Nano SIM standards in favour of an outdated Micro SIM slot.

While this might not sound like a big deal, it means that many people’s SIM cards, the tool that holds your unique phone number, won’t work with the new phone.

That will restrict them keeping in touch with friends using their existing phone number.

Although wannabe 3310 owners could simply buy the phone with a new pay-as-you-go SIM, distributing the new number to all the necessary people would be a faff.

While the 3310’s SIM slot issues are an annoyance, there’s still much excitement around the rebirth of the tech classic, and the problem is cheap enough to fix.

SIM card adaptors are widely available, letting users slot their Nano SIMs into the shell of a Micro SIM so that it will fit the phone.

These accessories can be snapped up from retailers such as Amazon for under £5.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the only issue affecting today’s Nokia 3310 launch.

The phone, which features a basic 2-megapixel camera and opts for physical buttons over a touchscreen display is already facing stock issues.

“The interest shown for this reimagined classic has been backed up by incredibly strong levels of pre-registration, and we have already sold out of very limited stock online, Carphone Warehouse’s Andrew Wilson said.

His thoughts were echoed by by rival retailer Vodafone which added: “We are delighted to be stocking the phone as demand has been really high.”

If you can find a store that hasn’t sold out, the Nokia 3310 will set you back just £49.99.","geeky"

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/618719/Worlds-heaviest-child-Arya-Permana-fattest-kid-documentary","World’s heaviest child recovering from surgery after nearly eating himself to DEATH","An 11-year-old boy who weighed 30st has had life-saving surgery after nearly eating himself to death.

Dubbed the world’s heaviest child, Arya Permana weighed as much as six boys his own age and struggled to walk more than five minutes at a time.

The Indonesian boy is the youngest ever person to undergo a five-hour gastric sleeve operation – something doctors has to convince his parents he needed after they spent “years over-feeding him”.

The surgery was performed by Dr Handi-Wing and removed a large portion of the stomach to make it smaller, which makes the patient’s appetite lessen and feel fuller for longer.

It’s been a month since Arya’s surgery and he has lost nearly 5st – he is expected to lose a further 15st over the course of the next year.

Before his surgery, Arya’s daily diet would include fried chicken, rice, noodles and chocolate ice cream – which he ate even after medical intervention and being given a low-fat diet and exercise programme, something his parents ignored.

""He ate like he had no sense of being full. Every time he had two packets of noodles and two eggs. More than half a kilo of chicken and then there was rice. This could be four to six times a day,” Arya’s father, Ade said.

""The saddest thing was watching Arya try to get up. He would get out of breath just walking five metres. We were very worried.""

Arya’s mother, Rokaya added: “I am the one the most to blame. I regret it because it's my fault. I didn't control how much I fed him. I keep feeding Arya because I love my child.""

Arya was of average weight until he turned five. Then, he explained, he felt like he wanted to eat “all the time”.

“When mum cooked I always waited for it. I liked to say 'mum hurry you cook.'""

In just four years, Arya had gained 20st – something which attracted international attention.

""Arya has been invited to Jakarta and Japan. He is very famous, so I feel happy,” Rokaya said.

This attention caused Dr Grace Judio to spend two days with the family to get to the bottom of the weight problem.

“What you're doing is killing him,” Grace told Arya’s parents. “You're going to be healthy but he will die.""

Even though Grace enforced a strict diet, Arya’s parents said it was hard to stick to.

His mum said: “The diet programme is very specific and it is difficult to get the right food. Arya is just a boy, if he wants to buy snacks, he will buy noodles and soft drinks, ice cream and chocolate ice. He does not want to follow the diet.""

This meant surgery – which was the last resort, and has so far been a success.

Arya added when he finally loses the weight he will: “Play with my friends in the pool, play football and ride bicycles.""

Arya is the subject of the documentary World's Heaviest Child: Extraordinary People, which will air tomorrow night (June 1) at 10pm on Channel 5.","boorish"

We've all told small fibs at times but new research reveals a whopping 47% of Brits keep their workplace eating habits a secret from their partner.

In fact nearly half of UK adults keep office nibbles to themselves and a fifth lie to their lover about their naughty snack and meal choices.

When it comes to indulging in treats, a traditional bacon sandwich topped the list of the UK’s favourite light bites with 49% confessing a butty is their go-to option for grazing.

Biscuits were the second most popular workplace snack, followed by crisps, sweets and pastries.

The news comes after recent research blamed “workplace cake culture” on widening our waistlines and contributing to health problems.

Wayne Lysaght-Mason, managing director of IronmongeryDirect who conducted the research, said: “The workplace can be a minefield of food temptations and despite best intentions, indulgent treats can replace healthy ones.

“Our sweet and savoury snacks then become secret and not shared with our partners.

“Those with demanding jobs are more likely to snack or eat on the go to keep their energy levels high for the physically demanding tasks.”

The worst workplace culprits for secret snacking were tradespeople like plumbers and builders, with 41% confessing to keeping their eating habits hush.

Meanwhile another recent study revealed a whopping 75% of Brits regularly lie to their partners – with men expected to tell the most porkies.

The poll of 2,000 adults by TV show Imposters also found that a quarter of the population don’t completely trust their current partner and 5% don’t trust them at all.

Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James said: “We Brits can sometimes be a rather suspicious bunch, but it seems we may have every right to be cautious since this research finds most people admit to lying to their partners, or being lied to.

“I’m surprised to see so many couples don’t trust each other though.”

However, women are less modest, with eight out of 10 believing they’re the more attractive part of their pairing.

A quarter of male respondents have also been told in no uncertain terms by friends, work colleagues and even their own parents that their partner is the winner in the looks department.

One in ten hapless blokes have even faced remarks about their better-looking spouses from complete strangers.

A poll of 2,000 people currently in relationships also pinpointed the exact age at which we’re most likely to punch above our weight – 26 years old for women, and 28 for men.

The study was commissioned to mark Comedy Central’s new comedy gameshow ’Your Face or Mine’ which continues tonight (Weds 31st) at 8pm. It’s a comeback of the cult 2002 original, hosted by Jimmy Carr and Katherine Ryan.

But with so many men punching above their weight it’s no surprise that nearly a third of men say looks are most important to them in a relationship, compared to less than a quarter of women.

Comedy Central’s spokesperson said: “They say opposites attract but it seems not all relationships are evenly matched in the looks department.

“Self-deprecation is a very British trait, but as we found in Your Face or Mine, it’s not only men who admit their partner is in a league above them.”

The research is also found that one in three Brits admitted that their ex was better looking than their current partner, but only one in nine have ever dared to reveal their thoughts to their other half.

It also emerged one in seven have stayed with someone longer than they really wanted to because they were good-looking; for shallow men this rises to nearly one in five.

The study also explored the ‘value’ of love, with one in 20 respondents admitting they would consider breaking up with a partner for hard cash.

The average figure it would take to break up a relationship came to £188,686, enough to buy an Aston Martin DB9 Bond Edition with plenty to spare.

Although one in five respondents said they’d consider leaving their other half for £100 or less.

Of the respondents who thought they were the better-looking half of their relationship, a self-confident 35 per cent were happy to brag about it to their partner – with more than half of the uglier respondents agreeing with the decision.

One in 10 Brits would rather be in a relationship with someone more attractive than them, with two thirds of them saying it would boost their self-esteem, and a quarter would enjoy making others jealous.

Michelle Greensmith, 33, and Craig Bignall, 34, met when Craig took the head chef job at the bar where Michelle worked, and they’ve been in a relationship for 18 months.

Michelle believes, unlike most women, that she’s the one punching above her weight in the looks department.

Michelle said: “Craig is certainly hotter than me. Everyone comments on how he looks like Olly Murs.

“We got talking when I brought a birthday cake into the kitchen that I had made for my mum’s 60th birthday.

Ryan Spencer, RS JOINERY

There aren’t many younger contenders for our title than Ryan, 22, who began his career working alongside his dad at the tender age of 14. Ryan, from Stockport, says a key part of his business is building customer relationships on Facebook and Instagram and he has even taken on an apprentice to help young people follow his entrepreneurial lead.

He says: “I love being my own boss. We do a bit of everything. We recently did a lot of work at a house in Alderley Edge. Who should walk out next door but Andrew Cole, the former United striker. “As a big United fan it meant a lot that he said he liked our work and we got a photo with him!”

Joe Cottam, JUST CALL JOE

Plenty of youngsters got a helping hand from Joe when they wanted to break into the building trade.

The 46-year-old, who left school with no qualifications, spent many years at night school and independent study learning his trade before deciding to pass it on.

He spent 17 years working at Highlands College on Jersey, teaching 14-to-17-year-olds the ropes.

Joe says: “It’s very satisfying to think I’ve launched people in their own career.”

Having now started his own maintenance firm, Just Call Joe, and moved to the north east he now helps out at the charity New Foundations in Kendal, Cumbria.

Joe says: “I work once a week doing all sorts of odd jobs, planing doors and fixing things.”

Ian Smith, IJS TRADE SERVICES

Big-hearted Ian did what every tradesman does when they hear a cry for help – work round the clock until the job is done.

Ian, whose heating and plumbing business is based near Brierley Hill, West Mids, discovered a local autism charity needed a complete heating refit.

The 37-year-old then did everything he could to come to their aid.

Ian, whose four-year-old son Brandon is autistic, says: “They had been quoted £12,000 for two complete systems which was too much for them.

“I rang around and got parts at a discounted rate and quoted my own labour at a reduced price, offering them a reduced rate saving £4-5,000.”

Simon Everett, NHS FOUNDATION TRUST

If there’s one competition hopeful who needs to get his work spot on, it’s Simon, 31, from Shropshire.

His job is to make sure everything is ticking over at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry, where he has been managing the 14-hectare site for fi ve years.

Simon is keen to show there are other careers in the building trade away from the usual ones, and knows working in a vital health department means his work is always important.

He says: “I upgraded all the surgical air plants and power in four new theatres. You can have the odd sleepless night, but at the end of the day you know all your work is extremely crucial which is very rewarding.”

Wesley Clark, WSC PLUMBING LIMITED

Few contenders walk a longer road to success than Wesley, who now lives in Reading.

Originally from Zimbabwe, Wesley, 34, has had to retrain and re-qualify himself to UK standards, even though he had years of experience abroad.

Plus he’s also faced mastering our weather and unique sense of humour.

Working 80-hour weeks, Wesley began his career as a brickie but soon discovered his own passion for plumbing.

He says: “I’m really proud of my 9/10 rating from customers and the Thank You cards I get. I think it’s vital to be organised and keep my van fully stocked so I don’t have to run out while on the job to get items.

“Customers really appreciate that.”

Entry closes on June 4, with the grand final being held in July.","boorish"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/618266/Children-swimming-body-issues-swimwear-shy-fitness","Body issues: Children as young as four embarrassed to be seen in a swimsuit","Kids are refusing to enter the pool because they are not comfortable getting undressed and wearing swimming gear in front of strangers.

One in four parents admitted their youngsters were shy about their physical appearance in swimwear.

And one in five children are so afraid that other kids will laugh at them that they would rather not go swimming at all.

It means many children are not taking part in an activity which is good for fitness and could save their life.

Getting ready before and after a swimming lesson, including taking a shower, and getting covered in chlorine in the water was also a turn-off for more than half of children.

Consultant psychologist Dr Simon Moore said: “We might think it’s as simple as a ‘fear of water’, but there’s just as much emotional fear in what children have to wear, the fear of shampoo in the eyes, or in getting undressed in the changing rooms.”

He added: “Parents can also inadvertently fan the flames by being unempathetic, or even threatening punishment, creating heightened achievement expectations and making the whole swimming experience anxiety led.”

The research, carried out by leisure charity Fusion Lifestyle, found up to 40% of school age children have never had swimming lessons.","boorish"

The Instagram phenomenon has seen her followers steadily rise as she's modelled for brands such as Maxim, Playboy, Monster Energy and the Ultimate Armwrestling League.

And now the brunette has rewarded her fans for helping her hit 10 million followers by sharing an incredibly risque clip.

The video shows Ana walk onto a beach wearing a figure-hugging, white bikini as a man sings: ""10 million people can't be wrong.""

She then bends over in the sand to show off her bum to the camera before giving viewers an eyeful of her ripped abs.

The social media star then rolls around on the beach in front of a setting sun and heads to the shower to wash away the sand.

Ana's steamy video was posted with the caption: ""10 million people!

""Thank you for giving me your love and support on my journey through fitness, modeling and life with a side of eye candy!

""Here's to 10 million more.""

Over 1.1 million people have watched the clip and her dedicated fans flooded the comments section with praise.

""Beautiful and luscious,"" wrote one Instagram user.

And another commented: ""You are so beautiful. I must be dreaming.""

Meanwhile, another model celebrated the start of the summer with a racy semi-nude video.

In the first clip, female workers can be seen handling the recycled cans which are then canned by a machine on a conveyor belt in the next clip.

Then, the third clip shows a Trade and Industry Bureau taskforce arriving at the factory to check out the products at the factory in Dongguan, China.

According to city authorities, the underground factory was able to churn out 600,000 crates of fake Bud a month, which were then distributed to bars and nightclubs.

Budweiser has become the third largest beer brand in China and has 14 breweries in the country.

But it has made them a prime target for counterfeiters.

The interaction appears to go smoothly – but suddenly there is a loud bang and the driver can be heard screaming in surprise.

A body rolls across the windshield as a rider-less motorbike careens out into the road in front.

Horrified, the driver hops out to check on the welfare of the stricken bloke as he picks himself up off the ground.

But she makes the nightmarish mistake of forgetting to apply the handbrake, leaving the car to roll back downhill as she begins to give chase in a pair of heels.

Eventually, the car comes to a stop having bashed into a tree bordering the narrow country lane shortly before the clip ends.

It is unclear whether the motorbike rider sustained any injuries in the smash.

Amateur spy satellite tracker Marco Langbroek believes the satellite, called USA 276, could come within 12 miles of the station.

And his prediction has sparked wild theories as to why it might flyby so close.

One is that it could be a test of new ways of spying on other nation’s satellites in space.

This could lead to a new era of space surveillance, with space station docking, rocket launches and satellite deployments all closely monitored by spy satellites.

""I still don't know what to think of this all,"" Langbroek wrote on his blog.

""Are these figments of my imagination or is there really something going on here? I am at a loss.""

Siddiq posted outrageous taunts suggesting Britain deserved the horrific slaughter of pop fans in the Manchester Arena.

He posted: “Do they think they can prod a hornet’s nest and not get stung?”

Keyboard warrior Siddiq also claimed the bombing of Ariana Grande’s gig was “an inevitable consequence” of Britain’s actions abroad.

In Nottingham – where he regularly preaches on the streets – Siddiq was cuffed for his comments.

Hamerton Zoo said it is ""co-operating fully with the investigation"".

Bank holiday visitors rushed inside keepers’ huts amid the “blood-curdling screams” of Ms King on Sunday.

Tragically, the 34-year-old lost her life after finding herself in the same cage as a tiger.

Defra blasted zoo bosses four years previously over its safety system that needed to be ""upgraded”.

The report said: “Inspectors consider reliance on mobiles to communicate in an emergency is not sufficient and the system needs to be upgraded to ensure that all relevant staff can be contacted simultaneously.”

Mum Andrea King, 54, said: “She wouldn’t have done anything else, it’s what she has always done, it’s what she always loved.”

A one-time volunteer of the zoo paid respect to the “kind, passionate” keeper in a note left in tribute.

Huntingdonshire Council has launched an investigation into Ms King’s death.

In a statement, the Huntingdon animal park expressed their ”huge regret” that Rosa, “an invaluable and highly respected member of our team” passed away.

Hamerton Zoo said: “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Rosa's family and friends, many of whom worked alongside her at the zoo.""

An unnamed family member told The Sun: “It sounds like she was left to work in a death trap. It’s all too raw right now.”

In the latest inspection report in 2015, no security issues from previous reports were brought up. The report concluded: ""Escapes have been notified when necessary"".

Hamerton Zoo has not yet responded to Daily Star Online for comment.

But animal charity boss Chris Draper entirely blames the zoo for not keeping up safety systems.

“Something has clearly gone wrong,"" the director of the Born Free Foundation said.

“It could be to do with training, infrastructure or the communications systems in place.

“The onus always falls on the zoos themselves to ensure the safety of the keepers and their visitors.""

Investigators will now check the steel safety bars designed to keep big cats separate from keepers.

Claims that one of the two safety gates “was still raised” as Ms King entered to clean the cage are being looked into.

A friend described the keeper at work as “methodical” and “so focused on what she was doing”.

This is the same zoo from which a cheetah escaped and turned up in a nine-year-old’s back garden in 2008.

"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/618769/Worst-sex-positions-she-hates-be-better-at-sex","The six WORST sex positions of all time","In the UK, we like to keep things simple. Time and time again, polls show our three favourite sex positions are doggy style, missionary and girl on top.

Sometimes we like to be adventurous with a bit of reverse cowgirl, or not-so-adventurous with spooning sex – bottom line is, we like to play it safe.

But here are six of the worst sex positions we should all just steer clear of:

6. Standing up sex

Unless he’s the strongest man in the world, holding a woman up while trying to have sex for a prolonged period of time sounds painful.

There’s too much going on here. Firstly the woman is basically trying to balance not completely smothering her man’s face, while giving him oral sex and trying to concentrate on being relaxed enough to orgasm herself. All a bit tiring really.

4. The Erotic Accordion

In this position the man lies on his back and brings his knees to his chest while the woman squats over him and sits on his penis – which is hopefully poking between the gap in his legs.

While probably not too tricky to start with, once the woman begins to bounce up and down things could take a turn for the worse and who knows where legs will end up (in the face).

3. Shower sex

While it’s always attempted with good intentions, shower sex is slippery and dangerous and there is never enough room.

2. The Wheelbarow

Like an x-rated wheelbarrow race, the woman kneels on the floor and rests her head in her arms in front of her. So far, so good.

Then the man lifts her feet and holds her knees at waist height while you have sex – so the woman is doing a strange plank-like position. While it could be comfortable if there is a soft ground underneath the woman, the chances of partners being the right height ratio to achieve this is very slim.

1. The Squat

Yep, this one is by far the worst sex position of all time. There is absolutely nothing sexy about a woman in a squat position over her man, bouncing on his dick.

Kudos to you ladies that have the thigh muscles and stamina to pull this off – but know this is the position you will most likely let out some unexpected gas. Sexy.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/618663/How-to-have-better-sex-can-long-distance-relationships-work-study","Couples who do this ONE thing have better sex – are you in the club?","While long-distance relationships have long been viewed to be destined for failure, they might actually be the secret to making a relationship work.

Contrary to popular belief, a LDR could actually increase the intimacy and communication between a couple, research shows.

Alyssa Dweck, M.D., a gynaecologist, said: “It's unclear exactly what kind of effect a sex break has on the body, but there has been research on long-distance couples who see each other only on the weekend.

“They have enhanced physical and emotional intimacy, thanks to better communication and overall reflection and respect for their partners.”

Alyssa’s claims are backed up by a 2013 study that surveyed 474 females ad 243 males in long distance relationships and 314 females and 111 males who were not separated by distance.

“Contrary to popular belief, young unmarried people in long-distance dating relationships do not report lower relationship quality than those in geographically close relationships,” study author and psychologist Emma Dargie said.

The research, conducted by Queens University, found “the further apart the couple was, the better they were doing with respect to satisfaction, intimacy and communication”.

Study author Karen Blair added: “Being further apart from your partner changes how you interact with them and forces you to work on some of the areas of relationship maintenance that geographically close couples may take for granted, and often overlook.”

If you can’t be away from each other physically – a sex break could do the trick.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine star, Terry Crews recently revealed he and his wife of 25 years participated in a three-month sex break – something he said helped him feel more emotionally connected to his wife.

“I found that at the end of the 90 days I was more in love, more turned on. I knew who she was,” Terry revealed.

Dr Anne Ridley, clinical sexologist and intimacy expert said, “I have prescribed a “penetration vacation” to couples who are experiencing specific issues in their intimate connection, whether emotional, sexual or both.”

Sexologist Dr Jess O’Reilly added: “When the brain lacks stimuli (as in the case of sensory deprivation, for example), it looks for new stimuli; though a sex hiatus isn’t sensory deprivation per se, it is common for couples to discover new methods of connection and traits of attraction when they take sex off the table.

“Deprivation can help to build desire and increase the intensity of physical and psychological response once you delve back into sexual activity at the end of the sex fast.”

While we’re not saying you need to up and move to a different country, even just a self-imposed sex break every once in a while can be beneficial to the intimacy levels of a relationship.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/618205/Most-common-sexual-fetish-dominatrix-foot-fetish-weird-fetishes","This is the most common sexual fetish – according to a dominatrix","In the world of sexual fetishes, they can range from something as minor as toe sucking to having sex with a robot.

While there are probably some more extreme fetishes out there, apparently there is one that is by far the most common.

According to Jenny Nordbak, the most common fetish is a foot fetish – and she would know.

The now-retired dominatrix, who spent a year working as a dominant and submissive in a sex dungeon in LA told the Daily Star Online: “Tonnes of people have a foot fetish– there’s a whole spectrum.

“For some guys it’s perfectly manicured clean feet and for others it’s stinky, dirty feet. Some want feet that are smashing something, or popping bubble wrap or in a certain kind of shoe.

“There is a broad range of fetishes that fall under it. Usually it’s a foot massage, we called it “foot worship”, so I would get paid to have a foot massage for an hour.”

Jenny, who said her clients were usually powerful males in their 40’s, added that corporal punishment, bondage and role play fantasies were also common.

She continued: “Humiliation was an interesting one. It works differently for different men. Some men want to be worshipping your feet while you say degrading things to them, others are straight men who like to be forced to cross dress, sissification is what that’s called. You’re making them 'sissies'.”

The 29-year-old said men dressing up as women was common as they’ve “got a curiosity about the feminine look”.

She added that she came across fetishes that “defied categories”.

“There are a number of men who have a fixation of air being let out of things. So if you stab a pool inflatable and the air starts leaking out of it – that’s their fetish.

“Lot’s of men are into fantasy wrestling, they want a woman to conquer them and wrap their thighs around his head and smother them. Some of those guys would tell me about early childhood incidents where girls had done that to them and ever since then they had fixated on that. I can kind of see where those came from, but how do you decide that air being let out of a pool float is a sexual thing for you?”

Jenny revealed she was only ever uncomfortable with someone’s fetish when it was something disgusting, like men who were into being made to lick a broom, the ground or an ash tray – or they wanted to be forced to clean a toilet.

“I always tried to find a way to pretend they were doing these things without them having to be hospitalised because it made them sick.”","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/618226/Worst-lie-women-tell-during-sex-is-she-on-birth-control","This is the worst lie women tell during sex – and it’s shocking","When we think of the worst thing a woman could lie about during sex, we would assume it would be whether they’d had an orgasm.

Because, after all, only 20% of women can orgasm from vaginal penetration alone and according to a survey by the Daily Star Online 60% of women said they’ve faked an orgasm during sex.

However, a new poll conducted by Direct TV asked 2,000 people what lies were the worst someone could say during sex.

Number one? “I’m on birth control.”

According to the survey, this is the absolute worst lie a woman can tell during sex – rather understandable as lying about this can have some pretty serious consequences (i.e. a child one party isn't ready for).

This is followed by, “I’m not just looking for sex,” lying about the number of people they’ve slept with and, “you’re the first person I’ve ever done this with.’

Also included in the list were non-sexual lies.

“I always wash my hands after using the bathroom” was considered the worst non-sexual lie followed by “I’ve never smoked” and “Miss you, too”.

The survey also revealed co-workers and family are the people we lie to most, followed by friends and significant others.

Those that do lie to their partners lie on average once per day – and those that live with their partners but aren’t married lie the most.

Meanwhile, further research of 18,000 people found women use the alibi “going out with friends” when they are cheating on their partner.

Two thirds of women use this lie when they are sneaking off for sex, other popular lies include, “I’m taking some me time” or saying something has come up at work.","vulgar"
"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/617981/How-to-oral-sex-women-giving-men-love","Do men really like GIVING oral sex? Their answers will shock you","Men perform cunnilingus to “minimise the risk of infidelity”, according to a study published in the Scientific Journal Evolutionary Psychology.

The research, at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, determined that men perform the sex act as part of a “mate retention tactic”.

But our recent poll revealed another reason they might be keen to give oral sex – because they like it.

We asked men “do you enjoy giving oral sex” and the answers were surprisingly positive.

A whopping 67% of the 695 guys you took part said “yes – I find it very pleasurable”.

A further 20% said “I don’t mind doing it”, while only 8% said “I’ve tried it but it’s not really for me.

Rather surprisingly though, 5% of men said they’ve never tried it and never will.

On the other hand only 28% of women said they love performing fellatio on their partners.

Researchers asked 500 straight college women about their most recent sexual experience and found that 60% gave oral sex during it.

However, less than a third of them said they found the experience “very pleasurable”.

Just over half said it was “somewhat pleasurable” and 17% said they didn’t enjoy it at all.","vulgar"

But according to science the search for your “soulmate” may actually be ruining your chances of having a fulfilling sex life.

A recent study revealed people who believe in sexual destiny were more likely to be unhappy with the sex lives.

On the other hand people who believed in sexual growth were much more likely to be satisfied between the sheets.

In summery, people who believe in soulmates aren’t willing to put the effort in if they don’t think they’ve found “the one”.

But couple who don’t believe there is only one person for each of us, put it a lot more effort to satisfy their partner in the sack.

The study included over 1,900 people, all at different relationship stages.

Jessica Maxwell, a PhD candidate in the department of psychology at the University of Toronto, said both types of couples experience a honeymoon period were the sex is great.

The blissful bedroom period lasted an average of two to three years. Both groups were happy with their love lives during this time, but after this the contrast between the group became greater.

Jessica said: ""We know that disagreements in the sexual domain are somewhat inevitable over time.

“[But] your sex life is like a garden, and it needs to be watered and nurtured to maintain it.""

Basically it comes down to effort. If you put the time and effort in, you’re sex life will be great, if you don’t it won’t.","vulgar"

1. Smoking

This was the biggest turn off for men.

2. Feet

While many men have a foot fetish, it can be a turn off for some.

3. Someone without ambitions

“Write music, research biology, play soccer, I don't care just do something to make yourself interesting,” one user commented.

It seems men can be deterred by a woman’s not-so-pearly whites.

Thought sex dolls were creepy? Well, now there's a teddy bear vibrator – brainchild of a company called Teddy Love.

Creator Dawn Harmon described him as: “A unique, discreet, and lovable adult Teddy Bear”. Right.

Teddy’s nose contains a 10-speed, battery-powered motor which can be used to “stimulate the clitoris while the retractable tongue penetrates the vagina”.

The vibrator in question first made headlines a few years back when it was bring crowdfunded, but now it’s on the market and being tried and tested by a few brave women.

One Amazon reviewer said: “As innocent as it looks it shouldn't be left out for kids to get their hands on.

""Clean up is easy, but the fur absorbs the smell of any thing it touches so cleaners with strong fragrances should be avoided unless you don't mind the smell.

""The vibrations we're not as strong but that's just my opinion.”

Another women, Kate Sloan, wrote a review of the toy for Glamour. She said, “The Teddy Love is, it must be said, intensely creepy.

""The glassy, dead eyes of a typical teddy bear, when paired with its protruding tongue straight out of a psychosexual fever dream.

“It is deeply upsetting to shift a bear’s face around against your junk in search of a comfortable position for the rigid nose and pointy tongue.

""It is deeply upsetting to look down between your legs and see what appears to be a teddy bear performing cunnilingus on you.”

She added: “While I think a teddy bear vibrator is theoretically a nice idea for people whose kinks involve stuffed animals or people who like their sex toys cuddly and unintimidating, this particular one is so poorly designed as to be painful.

“A vibrator should have a good motor, should be easy to clean, and should not ignite existential horror in the very depths of your soul when you look at it.”

Still, if this sounds like something you’d be into (no judgement), you can purchase your very own teddy for a mere £18.","vulgar"

The survey was conducted by contraceptive app Natural Cycles who asked more than 2,600 women what age they have the best orgasms.

As it turns out, your mid-thirties is when climaxes reach peak intensity. The women also said it was this age they felt most attractive and enjoyed sex more at this age.

The survey measured female sexuality through a number of categories including satisfaction (frequency of intercourse, satisfaction of partner), attraction (in the eyes of a partner and self-perceived) and orgasm (enjoyment and frequency).

In general, the older women get, the better sex is. The survey also found that women aged between 23 and 36 say they are least happy with how they looked.

Only 76% of the same age group said they’s had really enjoyable sex in the past four weeks compared to 86% of women over 36.

The respondents also revealed how much sex they were having per week and a third of respondents said they had intercourse twice a week, 20% said three times a week and just under a fifth said once a week.

Meanwhile, another recent study of 26,000 people in their 50s and 60s found 46 is the age people will have the best sex of their lives.

So why not take advantage of the mini heatwave by raising the temperature in the bedroom... and beyond? Here are our 20 top tips to help you sizzle!

1. The Bank Holiday weekend starts today!

So leave the working week behind by shedding your clothes as soon as you finish for the break.

Slip into something racy so you’re in the mood for action.

2. WHAT better way to cool down than taking a shower?

And sex things up by inviting your other half along with a tantalising drop of your towel as you head into the bathroom.

3. WORK up a sweat.

Perspiration causes pheromones to be released.

They’re odourless so you aren’t conscious of the scent, but they subliminally attract others to you.

4. IF you’re getting a drink to cool down, grab some ice cubes while you’re near the freezer.

Rub them down your partner’s body to turn them on.

5. OR try freezing aphrodisiacs like strawberries and chocolate, melting them on warm skin and feeding them to your partner.

6. WHILE it’s too warm outdoors, see if you can make it even hotter indoors with a saucy movie marathon.

Watch both of the Fifty Shades films and try recreating Christian and Ana’s steamiest moments.

7. CATCH some rays.

Libidos leap during a heatwave because sunlight lifts our mood, raising levels of the happiness hormone serotonin – and we have one third more testosterone in our bodies than in the winter.

8. GET rid of those comfy PJs and go to bed naked.

Don’t tell your partner so they get a sexy surprise when they reach for that cuddle goodnight.

9. STEAL far away from the madding crowd.

At that BBQ or Bank Holiday party disappear for an impromptu, bite-sized sex session.

10. HAVE some al fresco fun. Jump in the hot tub if you have one, or improvise with a paddling pool.

Anything that gets you both in swimwear is bound to get pulses racing.

11. FIT in a quick iron-pumping gym session.

It will make you feel better about your body – and give you an extra energy boost for some saucy fun. And sexercise is a great way to burn even more calories!

12. IF you are cooling off with icy treats, try eating them in a sexy way in front of your partner.

Try some suggestive tongue action on a Calippo or a 99.

13. CHANGE your scenery.

If you’re stuck in a rut of having sex in the same place, use the extra day off to try some new locations around your house.

14. EAT light.

A big bloated belly will not put you in the mood for romance, so pick light and healthy dishes.

Use the weather to strike up a conversation with that sexy stranger. After all, there’s nothing we Brits love talking about more.

16. GET out and about.

Go to the beach, get a cheap hotel for the night and make the most of being away from home.

Or cuddle in the park for starters, then head home for the main course.

17. RECREATE the sex scenes from your favourite TV dramas this year.

Poldark’s back next month – why not try some role play as Ross and Demelza?

18. MAKE an extra-special effort for your loved one by buying new undies, a sexy new outfi t or a new scent

19. MASSAGE each other with high SPF tanning oil.

It will keep you safe from the rays and give you sensuous skin-on-skin contact.

20. STICK on some tunes, get the beers in, put up your tent in your garden and pretend you’re getting fruity in a field.","vulgar"

NASA already knows that the ferocious fireball can fling highly damaging metals towards the earth in seconds – and now the race is on to find out how to stop it.

Scientists need to find out if the raging star is about to create an explosion that would wipe out electricity on earth and cost the economy trillions.

The announcement will take place at 3pm on NASA’s website.

The Solar Probe will withstand unbelievable heat – 2,500F (1,377C) – to fly into the massive star.

At its closest passes, the spacecraft must survive solar intensity of about 475x what spacecraft endure while spinning near Earth.

Coated in a 12cm carbon shield, the probe will swoop within just 3.9 million miles (6.2 million Km) of the radiation-spewing orb.

Boffins want to know why the solar corona is so much hotter than the photosphere and find out how solar wind is whipped up.

It’s basically a fancy weather forecast – for space.

The manless mission will battle through Mercury’s orbit to make it to the danger zone.

Reacting to the news, one social media comment: ""NASA has decided to take up a daredevil move”.

Others have joked, “Better do it at night”.

Benefits of the history-defining trip could be improving electric grids on earth, learning about radiation we get on aeroplanes and making satellites work better.

The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland is tinkering with the tech after their designs were approved in July.

A mega pair of telescopes will take close-and-personal new pictures of the sun and even snap eruptions and “other structures” near the sun.

Other instruments will measure the radio waves, plasma and particle temperatures of our mysterious star.
